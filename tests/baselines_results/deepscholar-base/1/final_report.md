**Efficient serving of large language models (LLMs) relies heavily on effective key-value (KV) caching mechanisms**. Caching intermediate results after processing each request substantially improves serving throughput and latency \[[Woosuk Kwon' 2023-09-12](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06180v1)\]. However, the benefits of KV caching are highly dependent on system design decisions, such as cache eviction policies, which are workload-dependent \[[Haoyang Li' 2024-12-27](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19442v2)\].

Several studies have proposed various KV cache management strategies, including token-level, model-level, and system-level optimizations \[[June Yong Yang' 2024-02-28](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18096v1)\]. Token-level strategies include KV cache selection, budget allocation, merging, quantization, and low-rank decomposition \[[June Yong Yang' 2024-02-28](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18096v1)\]. Model-level optimizations focus on architectural innovations and attention mechanisms to enhance KV reuse \[[June Yong Yang' 2024-02-28](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18096v1)\]. System-level approaches address memory management, scheduling, and hardware-aware designs to improve efficiency across diverse computing environments \[[June Yong Yang' 2024-02-28](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18096v1)\].

Some notable works include PagedAttention \[[Woosuk Kwon' 2023-09-12](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06180v1)\], which achieves near-zero waste in KV cache memory and flexible sharing of KV cache within and across requests. vLLM, a system built on top of PagedAttention, improves the throughput of popular LLMs by 2-4Ã— with the same level of latency compared to state-of-the-art systems \[[Woosuk Kwon' 2023-09-12](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06180v1)\]. Other works, such as Mixed-precision KV cache (MiKV) \[[Hanchen Li' 2025-03-18](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14647v1)\] and QAQ \[[Shichen Dong' 2024-03-07](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04643v2)\], propose reliable cache compression methods that preserve context details and ensure generation quality.

Recent studies have also explored the reuse of KV caches across different requests and conversations \[[Tianyu Guo' 2025-05-28](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21889v2)\]\[[Bin Gao' 2024-03-23](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19708v3)\]. CachedAttention \[[Bin Gao' 2024-03-23](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19708v3)\] enables reuse of KV caches across multi-turn conversations, significantly reducing repetitive computation overheads. Similarly, EFIM \[[Tianyu Guo' 2025-05-28](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21889v2)\] proposes a transformed prompt format to unleash the performance potential of KV cache reuse in infilling tasks.

Characterization of KV workload patterns has also been studied \[[Hanshi Sun' 2024-10-28](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21465v3)\]\[[Cunchen Hu' 2024-06-25](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17565v3)\]. MemServe \[[Cunchen Hu' 2024-06-25](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17565v3)\] presents a unified system that integrates inter-request and intra-request optimizations, introducing an elastic memory pool managing distributed memory and KV caches.

Our work builds upon these studies, providing a systematic characterization of KV workload patterns from a leading LLM service provider. We draw observations that can inform the design of workload-aware cache eviction policies, which improve serving performance under real-world traces, especially with limited cache capacity.

Large language model (LLM) serving and inference optimization have gained significant attention in recent years. Efficient serving of LLMs requires optimizing key-value (KV) cache memory, which can be huge and dynamic, leading to waste and fragmentation \[[Woosuk Kwon' 2023-09-12](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06180v1)\]. Various approaches have been proposed to address this issue, including PagedAttention, which inspires an attention algorithm from virtual memory and paging techniques \[[Woosuk Kwon' 2023-09-12](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06180v1)\]. Other works, such as vLLM, propose near-zero waste in KV cache memory and flexible sharing within and across requests \[[Woosuk Kwon' 2023-09-12](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06180v1)\]. Additionally, techniques like KV cache reusing \[[Hanchen Li' 2025-03-18](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14647v1)\], MorphServe \[[Zhaoyuan Su' 2025-05-24](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02006v1)\], MELL \[[Liu Qianli' 2025-01-12](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06709v1)\], and Knowledge Delivery Network (KDN) \[[Yihua Cheng' 2024-09-16](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13761v2)\] have been proposed to optimize LLM serving. These include optimizing cache eviction policies \[[Xuanfan Ni' 2025-02-24](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16886v1)\], attention mechanisms \[[Tianyu Guo' 2025-05-28](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21889v2)\], and memory management \[[Shiwei Gao' 2024-10-07](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05004v1)\]. Some works also focus on multi-GPU KV cache management \[[Liu Qianli' 2025-01-12](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06709v1)\], infilling tasks \[[Tianyu Guo' 2025-05-28](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21889v2)\], and long-context LLMs \[[Hanshi Sun' 2024-10-28](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21465v3)\]. Furthermore, methods like CacheBlend \[[Jiayi Yao' 2024-05-26](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16444v3)\] and SpeCache \[[Shibo Jie' 2025-03-20](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16163v1)\] aim to improve cache efficiency. These studies demonstrate the importance of optimizing KV cache in LLM serving, with improvements in throughput, latency, and memory usage \[[Woosuk Kwon' 2023-09-12](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06180v1)\]\[[Hanchen Li' 2025-03-18](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14647v1)\]\[[Zhaoyuan Su' 2025-05-24](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02006v1)\]\[[Liu Qianli' 2025-01-12](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06709v1)\]\[[Yihua Cheng' 2024-09-16](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13761v2)\]\[[Tianyu Guo' 2025-05-28](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21889v2)\].

Cache optimization techniques for large language models have gained significant attention due to the substantial memory overhead and increased attention latency associated with growing context lengths. One approach to address this issue is through the use of KV cache eviction methods. For instance, KVzip, a query-agnostic KV cache eviction method, enables effective reuse of compressed KV caches across diverse queries, reducing KV cache size by 3-4$\times$ and FlashAttention decoding latency by approximately 2$\times$, with negligible performance loss in various tasks \[[Jang-Hyun Kim' 2025-05-29](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23416v1)\]. This method quantifies the importance of a KV pair using the underlying LLM to reconstruct original contexts from cached KV pairs, subsequently evicting pairs with lower importance. The effectiveness of KVzip and other cache optimization techniques highlights the importance of efficient cache management in serving large language models, which is crucial for cloud providers to improve serving throughput and latency \[[Jang-Hyun Kim' 2025-05-29](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23416v1)\].

Efficient key-value (KV) cache management is crucial for accelerating large language models (LLMs) in various applications. KVLink, a approach for efficient KV cache reuse, precomputes the KV cache of each document independently and concatenates them during inference, achieving an average improvement of 4% in question answering accuracy and reducing time-to-first-token by up to 96% compared to standard LLM inference \[[Jingbo Yang' 2025-02-21](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16002v2)\]. Another approach, Titanus, proposes a software-hardware co-design to compress the KV cache on-the-fly, achieving 159.9x and 34.8x energy efficiency and throughput compared to Nvidia A100 GPU and FlightLLM, respectively \[[Peilin Chen' 2025-05-23](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17787v1)\]. These works demonstrate the significance of optimizing KV cache management for LLMs, highlighting the need for efficient cache reuse and compression techniques to improve performance and reduce latency.

### <a id='category-adaptive-kv-cache-eviction-and-budget-allocation'></a>Adaptive KV Cache Eviction and Budget Allocation: 1 papers found.
Efficient caching of intermediate results, particularly Key-Value (KV) cache, is crucial for serving large language models (LLMs) effectively. Recent studies have focused on optimizing KV cache eviction and budget allocation to improve serving throughput and latency. One approach involves evicting non-critical cache elements during runtime while preserving generation quality \[[Yuan Feng' 2024-07-16](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11550v4)\]. However, uniform allocation of compression budgets across all attention heads can be suboptimal, as it neglects unique attention patterns of each head. A head-wise adaptive budget allocation strategy, called Ada-KV, has been proposed to address this limitation, offering plug-and-play benefits and improving generation quality \[[Yuan Feng' 2024-07-16](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11550v4)\]. This approach has demonstrated substantial quality improvements over existing methods through extensive evaluations on 29 datasets. By adaptively allocating budgets, Ada-KV provides a promising solution for efficient KV cache management in LLMs \[[Yuan Feng' 2024-07-16](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11550v4)\].
