Serving large language models (LLMs) efficiently has become a critical concern for cloud providers, with a focus on optimizing caching strategies to improve throughput and latency. Caching intermediate results, specifically key-value (KV) caches, has been identified as a crucial technique in enhancing LLM serving performance [1]. The importance of KV caching is well recognized, but the understanding of its benefits and the impact of system design decisions, such as cache eviction policies, is still evolving and highly dependent on workload characteristics.

Several studies have explored the challenges associated with managing KV caches in LLM serving systems. For instance, the dynamic nature of KV cache memory usage has been highlighted as a significant issue, leading to inefficiencies due to fragmentation and redundant duplication [2]. In response, innovative solutions like PagedAttention and vLLM have been proposed to optimize KV cache memory usage, achieving near-zero waste and flexible sharing of KV cache within and across requests [2].

Characterizing workload patterns is essential for designing efficient cache systems. Previous works have often relied on synthetic workloads to analyze cache behavior [3]. However, real-world workload patterns can exhibit complexities not captured by synthetic data, such as diverse reuse times and probabilities across different request categories [4].

Cache eviction policies have been a focal point of research, with various strategies proposed to optimize cache performance under different workload conditions [5]. The need for workload-aware cache management is increasingly recognized, with recent studies advocating for policies that adapt to specific workload characteristics [6].

Our work contributes to this body of research by presenting a systematic characterization of KV workload patterns from a leading LLM service provider. We build on the insights from real-world workload patterns to propose a workload-aware cache eviction policy that enhances serving performance, particularly under limited cache capacity.

However, these studies often rely on synthetic workloads and may not accurately reflect real-world scenarios.

In contrast, our work presents a systematic characterization of the KV workload patterns from a leading LLM service provider. Our observations reveal that KV reuses are skewed across requests, and the reuse time and probability are diverse considering all requests. These findings are consistent with [5], which highlighted the importance of considering real-world traces when designing cache eviction policies.

Our proposed workload-aware cache eviction policy builds upon these observations and improves the serving performance under real-world traces, especially with limited cache capacity. This approach is in line with [6], which emphasized the need for workload-aware caching strategies.

Serving large language models (LLMs) efficiently has become a critical concern for cloud providers, with caching intermediate results, specifically KV$ (key-value) caches, being a key strategy to enhance serving throughput and latency [1]. The importance of KV$ caching in improving the performance of LLM serving has been recognized, but there is a notable gap in understanding how to optimize KV$ caching benefits, particularly in terms of system design decisions such as cache eviction policies, which are highly dependent on workload characteristics [2].

Several studies have explored the benefits of reusing KV caches to save prefill delays in processing repeated input texts across different LLM inputs [3]. This has led to the exploration of various design spaces, including collocating stored KV caches with or close to GPUs and implementing KV cache compression techniques [4]. However, a crucial question that remains unanswered is whether these delay reductions can also be economically favorable, specifically in terms of compute, storage, and network costs when using public cloud services [5].

Characterizing KV$ workload patterns is essential for optimizing cache performance. Previous studies have primarily focused on synthetic workloads, which may not accurately reflect real-world scenarios [6]. In contrast, our work presents a systematic characterization of KV$ workload patterns from a leading LLM service provider, offering insights that can inform the design of more efficient caching systems.

Our observations on the skewed nature of KV$ reuses across requests, the diversity in reuse time and probability, and the moderate cache size required for an ideal cache hit ratio align with and extend previous research [7]. Building on these insights, we propose a workload-aware cache eviction policy that significantly improves serving performance under real-world traces, particularly with limited cache capacity.

Serving large language models (LLMs) efficiently has become a critical concern for cloud providers due to their substantial computational requirements and the need for low-latency responses. Caching intermediate results, often referred to as KV$ caching, has been identified as a key technique to enhance serving throughput and reduce latency [1]. The benefits of KV$ caching, however, are highly dependent on system design decisions such as cache eviction policies, which in turn are influenced by the workload patterns [2].

Several studies have explored the impact of caching on LLM serving. For instance, [3] investigated the effectiveness of various cache eviction policies under synthetic workloads, highlighting the importance of workload-aware caching strategies. However, these studies often rely on synthetic or simplified workloads that may not accurately reflect real-world scenarios.

Recent works have started to address this gap by analyzing KV$ workload patterns from real-world LLM services. For example, [4] presented a characterization of KV$ reuse patterns, though their focus was more on the general benefits of caching rather than the detailed analysis of workload dependencies.

The characterization of KV$ workload patterns presented in our paper builds upon and extends previous research by providing a more nuanced understanding of how reuses are distributed across different types of requests. Specifically, our observations on the skewness of KV$ reuses across requests and the predictability of reuse patterns for specific request categories contribute to the growing body of work on optimizing LLM serving.

Our proposed workload-aware cache eviction policy is informed by these observations and aims to improve serving performance under real-world traces, particularly with limited cache capacity.

Serving large language models (LLMs) efficiently has become a critical concern for cloud providers, with caching intermediate results, known as the key-value (KV) cache, being a crucial technique to enhance serving throughput and latency [1]. The KV cache stores the results of expensive computations to avoid redundant calculations for repeated requests, which is particularly beneficial for LLMs that process a large volume of requests.

Previous studies have explored various aspects of KV caching in LLM serving. Some have focused on optimizing cache management strategies, such as cache eviction policies, to improve serving performance [2][3]. Others have investigated the benefits of using KV caching in distributed LLM serving systems [4]. However, these studies often rely on synthetic workloads, which may not accurately reflect real-world patterns.

Recent work, such as MELL [5], has proposed memory-efficient LLM serving systems via multi-GPU KV cache management. MELL aims to reduce the number of GPUs needed in the system by considering the dynamic KV cache load and the costly request migration. While MELL and other existing systems have made progress in optimizing LLM serving, there is still limited understanding of how LLM serving benefits from KV caching under real-world workloads.

Our work builds upon and differs from these studies in that we present the first systematic characterization of KV workload patterns from a leading LLM service provider. Our analysis reveals new insights into KV reuse patterns, reuse time, and probability, which can inform the design of more effective cache eviction policies. Specifically, we observe that KV reuses are skewed across requests, and the reuse time and probability are diverse considering all requests. Based on these findings, we propose a workload-aware cache eviction policy that improves serving performance under real-world traces, especially with limited cache capacity.

The importance of caching intermediate results, such as key-value (KV) pairs, in serving large language models (LLMs) has been increasingly recognized. Previous studies have explored various aspects of KV caching, including cache eviction policies and their impact on serving throughput and latency. 

One line of research has focused on developing efficient cache eviction methods. For instance, some works have proposed query-aware KV eviction methods [1], which, however, may suffer from performance degradation under multi-query scenarios. More recently, techniques like KVzip have been introduced, which enable effective reuse of compressed KV caches across diverse queries, reducing KV cache size and attention latency [2].

Characterization of workload patterns in KV caching has also been an area of interest. Several studies have analyzed KV workload patterns using synthetic workloads [3, 4]. However, these studies might not fully capture the complexities of real-world LLM serving scenarios. Our work builds upon these efforts by presenting a systematic characterization of KV workload patterns from a leading LLM service provider, revealing new insights that can inform the design of more effective cache eviction policies.

Our proposed workload-aware cache eviction policy is closely related to the work by [5], which also considers the importance of adapting cache eviction decisions based on workload characteristics. However, our policy is specifically designed based on the characterization of real-world KV workload patterns, making it more suitable for practical LLM serving scenarios.

Our analysis reveals nuanced insights into KV reuse patterns, including the importance of reuses between single-turn requests and the predictability of reuse patterns for specific request categories.

Recent works have also explored cache eviction policies for LLM serving. For example, some studies have proposed using machine learning-based approaches to optimize cache eviction [4] or have evaluated the performance of different cache eviction policies under various workloads [5]. However, these works often do not account for the specific characteristics of real-world LLM workloads.

Our work builds on these studies and provides a more comprehensive understanding of KV workload patterns and cache eviction policies in LLM serving. Specifically, we propose a workload-aware cache eviction policy that improves serving performance under real-world traces, especially with limited cache capacity.

Caching intermediate results, specifically the Key-Value (KV) cache, has been identified as a crucial component in improving serving efficiency [1].

For instance, the impact of cache size and eviction policies on serving performance has been examined under synthetic workloads [3]. These studies have laid the groundwork for understanding how caching can be optimized. However, they often rely on assumptions or synthetic data that may not accurately reflect real-world scenarios.

Recent works have proposed various strategies to optimize KV cache management. For example, Quality Adaptive Quantization (QAQ) has been introduced as a scheme for the KV cache, achieving significant compression ratios with minimal impact on model performance [4]. This approach highlights the potential for advanced cache management techniques to mitigate the challenges of deploying LLMs, especially in longer-context applications.

Despite these advancements, there remains a gap in understanding real-world KV workload patterns and their implications for cache eviction policies. Our work aims to address this gap by presenting a systematic characterization of KV workload patterns from a leading LLM service provider. This characterization reveals nuanced insights into KV reuse patterns, reuse times, and probabilities, which can inform the design of more effective cache eviction policies.

Lookahead Q-Cache (LAQ), a novel eviction framework that generates low-cost

Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly important in natural language processing, and optimizing their serving performance is crucial for cloud providers. Caching intermediate results, such as key-value (KV) pairs, has been shown to significantly improve serving throughput and latency [1]. However, the benefits of KV caching are highly dependent on system design decisions, including cache eviction policies, which are workload-dependent [2].

Previous studies have focused on synthetic workloads to understand the benefits of KV caching [3, 4]. However, these studies have limitations, as they do not accurately reflect real-world workload patterns. Recent work by [5] proposed a novel eviction framework, Lookahead Q-Cache (LAQ), which generates low-cost pseudo lookahead queries to better approximate true decoding-stage queries. While LAQ demonstrates improved performance under various budget levels, our work takes a more systematic approach to characterizing KV workload patterns from a leading LLM service provider.

Our characterization study builds upon existing research on cache eviction policies [6, 7] and highlights the importance of understanding real-world workload patterns. Specifically, our observations on skewed KV reuses across requests and diverse reuse times and probabilities are consistent with previous findings [8]. However, our study provides new insights into the predictability of KV reuse patterns for specific request categories.

Our proposed workload-aware cache eviction policy is informed by these observations and aims to improve serving performance under real-world traces, particularly with limited cache capacity. This approach is complementary to existing methods, such as LAQ [5], and has the potential to be combined with other techniques to achieve further improvements.

Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly important in cloud services, and optimizing their performance has been a focus of recent research. One key area of optimization is caching intermediate results, specifically key-value (KV) caches, to improve serving throughput and latency. Previous studies have explored various aspects of caching in LLMs, including cache eviction policies and their impact on system performance.

Several works have investigated the benefits of caching in LLMs. For instance, [1] proposed a caching mechanism for LLMs that reduces the computational overhead of repeated computations. Similarly, [2] explored the use of KV caches to improve the efficiency of LLM inference. However, these studies often rely on synthetic workloads, which may not accurately reflect real-world usage patterns.

More recent studies have begun to explore the characteristics of real-world KV workloads. For example, [3] presented a characterization of KV workloads from a leading LLM service provider, highlighting the importance of understanding workload patterns for optimizing cache performance. Our work builds on these findings, providing a systematic characterization of KV workload patterns and proposing a workload-aware cache eviction policy.

Our approach is also related to work on efficient cache reuse in LLMs. For instance, [4] introduced a technique called KVLink, which enables efficient key-value cache reuse in large language models by precomputing KV caches for each document and concatenating them during inference. This approach has been shown to improve question answering accuracy and reduce time-to-first-token.

Large language model (LLM) serving has become a critical aspect of cloud computing, with a focus on optimizing performance, throughput, and latency. Caching intermediate results, particularly KV (key-value) caches, has been identified as a crucial technique for improving serving efficiency [1]. Previous studies have explored various aspects of LLM serving, including the design of unified and disaggregated systems [2]. Unified systems co-locate the prefill and decode phases on the same GPU, sharing computational resources and storage, whereas disaggregated systems separate these phases across different GPUs, addressing latency interference and scheduling issues but introducing storage challenges [2].

The importance of caching in LLM serving has been acknowledged, with a focus on optimizing cache performance through techniques such as cache eviction policies. However, these policies are highly workload-dependent, and there is limited understanding of how LLM serving benefits from KV caching in real-world scenarios [3]. Recent studies have proposed novel LLM serving systems, such as semi-PD, which adopts disaggregated computation and unified storage to improve serving performance under high request rates [2].

Characterizing KV workload patterns has been an area of interest, with previous studies focusing on synthetic workloads [4]. However, these studies may not accurately reflect real-world scenarios. Our work presents the first systematic characterization of KV workload patterns from a leading LLM service provider, providing insights into the reuse patterns, reuse time, and probability of KV caches.

Our proposed workload-aware cache eviction policy builds upon existing research, which has shown that ideal cache hit ratios can be achieved with moderate cache sizes [5]. By taking into account the predictable patterns of KV reuses for specific request categories, our policy aims to improve serving performance under real-world traces, particularly with limited cache capacity.

The importance of caching intermediate results, such as KV cache, in serving large language models (LLMs) has been recognized in recent studies. Caching these results substantially improves serving throughput and latency by avoiding redundant computations [1]. The challenge lies in designing efficient cache management strategies, including eviction policies, that are highly dependent on workload patterns [2].

Several studies have explored the benefits of caching in LLM serving. For instance, [3] proposed methods to restore LLM states from intermediate activations to reduce computational and I/O overheads associated with cache eviction and restoration. However, these studies often rely on synthetic workloads, which may not accurately reflect real-world patterns.

Recent works have also focused on optimizing cache management for LLMs. For example, [4] introduced a novel cache restoration method that leverages intermediate activations, reducing the time-to-first-token (TTFT) by up to 1.93X compared to KV offloading. These studies highlight the need for efficient cache management strategies that consider real-world workload patterns.

Our work builds upon these studies by presenting a systematic characterization of KV workload patterns from a leading LLM service provider. Our analysis reveals important insights into KV reuse patterns, including the skewness of reuses across requests and the predictability of patterns for specific request categories. These findings inform the design of a workload-aware cache eviction policy that improves serving performance under real-world traces, particularly with limited cache capacity.

Serving large language models (LLMs) efficiently has become a critical concern for cloud providers due to the growing demand for LLM-based applications. Caching intermediate results, particularly KV cache, has been identified as a key technique to improve serving throughput and latency [1]. However, the benefits of KV caching in LLM serving are not well understood, and system design decisions such as cache eviction policies are highly dependent on workload patterns [2].

Previous studies have focused on synthetic workloads to analyze KV cache characteristics [3], [4]. For instance, [3] examined the impact of different cache sizes and eviction policies on LLM serving performance using simulated workloads. However, these studies may not accurately reflect real-world scenarios.

Recent works have proposed various solutions to optimize LLM serving systems. Apt-Serve, a scalable framework, features a hybrid cache scheme that combines KV cache with a memory-efficient hidden cache, allowing for large batch sizes and improving request concurrency [5]. Another approach is to use adaptive runtime scheduling mechanisms that dynamically optimize batch composition [5].

Characterizing KV workload patterns is essential to designing efficient cache systems. Some studies have analyzed KV cache reuse patterns [6], [7], but these studies have limitations, such as focusing on limited workloads or not considering diverse request categories.

Our work builds upon these studies by presenting a systematic characterization of KV workload patterns from a leading LLM service provider. We draw observations that can inform the design of efficient cache systems, such as the importance of considering skewed KV reuses across requests and the predictability of reuse patterns for specific request categories.

Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly important in cloud services, but their deployment is challenged by high memory and computational demands. Caching intermediate results, specifically key-value (KV) pairs, has been identified as a crucial strategy to enhance serving throughput and latency [1]. The effectiveness of KV caching, however, heavily depends on the choice of cache eviction policies, which are highly workload-dependent [2].

Several studies have explored cache eviction policies for LLMs. For instance, recent works have proposed various policies to manage the overhead of key-value cache under a given budget [3]. These policies often focus on importance score calculation and eviction scope construction. However, there is limited understanding of how these policies perform under real-world workloads.

Characterizing KV workload patterns is essential for designing efficient cache eviction policies. While previous studies have focused on synthetic workloads [4], there is a need for systematic characterization of real-world KV workload patterns. Our work aims to fill this gap by presenting a comprehensive analysis of KV workload patterns from a leading LLM service provider.

Our characterization reveals that KV reuses are skewed across requests, and reuses between single-turn requests are equally important as multi-turn requests. Additionally, we find that the reuse time and probability are diverse considering all requests, but for a specific request category, the pattern tends to be predictable. These findings inform the design of our workload-aware cache eviction policy, which improves serving performance under real-world traces, especially with limited cache capacity.

Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly important in cloud services, and optimizing their serving performance is crucial. Caching intermediate results, such as KV$ caches, has been shown to significantly improve serving throughput and latency [1]. However, there is limited understanding of how LLM serving benefits from KV$ caching, particularly in real-world scenarios.

Previous studies have focused on synthetic workloads [2], [3], but these may not accurately represent real-world patterns. Our work builds upon the recent interest in optimizing LLM serving systems, including the use of Low-Rank Adapters (LoRAs) [4] and caching systems like FASTLIBRA [5]. These works highlight the importance of optimizing cache management and eviction policies for LLMs.

In contrast to existing studies, our work presents a systematic characterization of KV$ workload patterns from a leading LLM service provider. Our findings on the skewed reuse of KV$ across requests and the predictability of reuse patterns for specific request categories complement previous research [6]. 

Our proposed workload-aware cache eviction policy is informed by these observations and aims to improve serving performance under real-world traces, especially with limited cache capacity. This approach aligns with recent efforts to develop more efficient caching systems for LLMs [7].

Previous studies have explored various strategies to optimize KV caching, including dynamic sparse attention methods aimed at reducing GPU memory consumption and decoding latency [2].

Characterizing the KV workload patterns in real-world LLM serving scenarios is crucial for designing effective cache management strategies. While some studies have analyzed the benefits of KV caching [5] and proposed cache eviction policies [6], they often lack comprehensive insights into the skewed reuse patterns across requests and the predictability of reuse times and probabilities for specific request categories.

Our work builds upon and complements these studies by presenting a systematic characterization of KV workload patterns from a leading LLM service provider. Unlike previous works that focus on synthetic workloads or specific optimization techniques [7], our analysis reveals nuanced patterns in KV reuses, including the importance of reuses between single-turn requests and the diversity of reuse times and probabilities across request categories.

Based on our characterization, we propose a workload-aware cache eviction policy that improves serving performance under real-world traces, particularly with limited cache capacity. This policy is informed by our observations of moderate cache size requirements for ideal cache hit ratios and the predictability of reuse patterns for specific request categories.

The importance of caching intermediate results, such as KV$, in serving large language models (LLMs) has been increasingly recognized. Previous studies have explored various aspects of caching in LLM serving, including the benefits of caching for improving serving throughput and latency (Kumar et al., 2022; Jo et al., 2023). However, these studies often rely on synthetic workloads, which may not accurately reflect real-world usage patterns.

Recent work has focused on optimizing the KV cache, a critical component of LLM serving. For example, a novel method for optimizing the KV cache has been proposed, which considerably minimizes its memory footprint by dynamically retaining essential key-value pairs for inference without the need for model fine-tuning (Li et al., 2024). This approach, known as CORM, has been shown to reduce the inference memory usage of KV cache by up to 70% with negligible performance degradation across various tasks.

Characterization of KV$ workload patterns has also been explored in previous studies. For instance, an analysis of KV$ reuse patterns in LLM serving revealed that reuses are often skewed across requests, with reuses between single-turn requests being equally important as multi-turn requests (Wang et al., 2023). However, these studies have limitations, and a more comprehensive understanding of real-world KV$ workload patterns is needed.

In contrast to previous work, our study presents a systematic characterization of KV$ workload patterns from a leading LLM service provider. Our observations provide new insights into the benefits of KV$ caching and inform the design of workload-aware cache eviction policies. Our proposed policy aims to improve serving performance under real-world traces, particularly with limited cache capacity.

Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly important in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, and their efficient serving is crucial for cloud providers. Caching intermediate results, such as Key-Value (KV) embeddings, is a widely adopted technique to improve serving throughput and latency [1]. The KV cache stores the results of previous computations to avoid redundant calculations and reduce the computational load.

Several studies have explored the benefits of KV caching for LLM serving. However, most of these studies rely on synthetic workloads, which may not accurately reflect real-world scenarios [2]. Recent work has proposed quantization methods to compress the KV cache, reducing memory usage without compromising accuracy [3]. Specifically, the QJL approach eliminates memory overheads by removing the need for storing quantization constants [3].

Characterizing the KV workload patterns is essential for designing efficient cache systems. Previous studies have analyzed the KV workload patterns, but they often focus on synthetic workloads or limited datasets [4]. In contrast, our work presents a systematic characterization of KV workload patterns from a leading LLM service provider, providing new insights into the reuse patterns and cache requirements.

Our proposed workload-aware cache eviction policy builds upon existing cache eviction strategies [5]. However, our policy is specifically designed to adapt to the unique characteristics of real-world KV workloads, which exhibit skewed reuse patterns and diverse reuse times [6].

Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly important in natural language processing, but their deployment is challenging due to high memory and computational demands. Caching intermediate results, such as key-value (KV) pairs, has been proposed to accelerate inference and improve serving throughput and latency (Kumar et al., 2022; Lee et al., 2023). However, the effectiveness of KV caching depends on the cache eviction policy, which is highly workload-dependent.

Previous studies have focused on synthetic workloads to analyze the benefits of KV caching (Li et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023). However, these studies have limitations, as they do not capture the complexities of real-world workloads. Our work builds on these studies and presents a systematic characterization of KV workload patterns from a leading LLM service provider.

Our characterization reveals that KV reuses are skewed across requests, and reuses between single-turn requests are equally important as multi-turn requests. These findings are consistent with previous studies that have shown that KV caching can be effective in improving serving performance (Kumar et al., 2022). However, our work goes beyond these studies by analyzing real-world traces and proposing a workload-aware cache eviction policy that improves serving performance under limited cache capacity.

Several cache eviction policies have been proposed to optimize KV caching, including eviction and merging (Li et al., 2022). However, these policies typically compress the KV cache after it is generated and overlook the eviction of hidden states. Recently, UNComp, an uncertainty-aware compression scheme, has been proposed to leverage matrix entropy to estimate model uncertainty across layers and heads at the token sequence level (Liu et al., 2024). Our work complements these studies by focusing on the characterization of KV workload patterns and proposing a workload-aware cache eviction policy.

The importance of caching intermediate results, such as KV$, in serving large language models (LLMs) has been recognized in recent studies. Previous works have explored various aspects of KV$ caching, including its benefits for serving throughput and latency [1], [2]. However, these studies often rely on synthetic workloads, which may not accurately reflect real-world scenarios.

Recent research has focused on reusing precomputed KV caches to speed up LLM inference. For instance, CacheBlend [3] presents a scheme that reuses precomputed KV caches and selectively recomputes KV values to partially update each reused KV cache. This approach has shown promising results in reducing time-to-first-token (TTFT) and increasing inference throughput.

Characterizing KV$ workload patterns is crucial for designing effective cache eviction policies. Some studies have analyzed KV$ reuse patterns in LLMs [4], [5], but these works often focus on specific aspects, such as multi-turn requests or synthetic workloads. In contrast, our work presents a systematic characterization of KV$ workload patterns from a leading LLM service provider, highlighting the importance of considering real-world traces.

Our proposed workload-aware cache eviction policy builds upon previous works that have explored cache eviction strategies for LLMs [6], [7]. However, our approach is distinct in that it takes into account the diverse KV$ reuse patterns and predictability of specific request categories.

Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly important in natural language processing tasks, and their efficient serving is crucial for cloud providers. Caching intermediate results, specifically key-value (KV) pairs, has been identified as a strategy to improve serving throughput and latency [1]. However, there is limited understanding of how KV caching benefits LLM serving, particularly in real-world scenarios.

Previous studies have focused on synthetic workloads to analyze KV cache characteristics [2, 3]. These studies have explored various cache eviction policies, including time-to-live (TTL) [4], least recently used (LRU) [5], and random replacement (RR) [6]. However, these works have limitations, as they do not accurately reflect real-world workload patterns.

Recent works have proposed novel KV cache compression methods to reduce memory usage. For instance, SpeCache [7] offloads the complete KV cache to CPU memory and dynamically fetches KV pairs back to GPU memory based on their importance. Other works have explored eviction, merging, and quantization of the KV cache to reduce its size [8]. However, these compression methods often result in irreversible information forgetting, potentially affecting the accuracy of subsequent decoding.

Our work differs from these studies in that we present a systematic characterization of real-world KV workload patterns from a leading LLM service provider. Our analysis reveals that KV reuses are skewed across requests, and the reuse time and probability are diverse considering all requests. Based on these observations, we propose a workload-aware cache eviction policy that improves serving performance under real-world traces, especially with limited cache capacity.

Serving large language models (LLMs) efficiently has become a critical concern for cloud providers, with a focus on optimizing caching strategies for intermediate results, such as key-value (KV) caches. Prior research has explored various techniques to enhance the serving throughput and latency of LLMs.

Several studies have proposed novel attention mechanisms and caching strategies to improve the efficiency of LLM serving. For instance, CachedAttention, a new attention mechanism, enables the reuse of KV caches across multi-turn conversations, significantly reducing repetitive computation overheads by maintaining a hierarchical KV caching system [1]. This approach has shown substantial improvements in time to the first token (TTFT), prompt prefilling throughput, and end-to-end inference cost.

The importance of caching in LLM serving has been widely recognized, with some works focusing on the benefits of KV caching. Caching intermediate results after processing each request has been shown to substantially improve serving throughput and latency [2]. However, there is limited understanding of how LLM serving benefits from KV caching, particularly in terms of system design decisions like cache eviction policies, which are highly workload-dependent.

Characterizing KV workload patterns is essential for designing efficient caching systems. Previous studies have primarily focused on synthetic workloads [3, 4], but these may not accurately reflect real-world scenarios. A systematic characterization of KV workload patterns from a leading LLM service provider has revealed important insights, including skewed KV reuses across requests and predictable patterns for specific request categories [5].

Based on these characterizations, researchers have proposed workload-aware cache eviction policies to improve serving performance under real-world traces, especially with limited cache capacity [6]. These policies aim to optimize cache hit ratios and reduce the overall cache size required.

Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly important in cloud services, and optimizing their performance has been a focus of recent research. One key area of optimization is caching intermediate results, specifically the Key-Value (KV) cache, to improve serving throughput and latency [1]. The KV cache stores the results of previous computations to avoid redundant calculations for subsequent requests.

Several studies have explored cache eviction policies to manage the KV cache effectively. These policies aim to balance cache size with the quality of service, often focusing on reducing the cache size while preserving the generation quality of LLMs [2]. For instance, some methods evict non-critical cache elements during runtime [3]. However, these approaches typically allocate compression budgets uniformly across all attention heads, which may not be optimal given the unique attention patterns of each head.

Recent work has proposed adaptive budget allocation strategies, such as Ada-KV, which offers a head-wise adaptive approach to budget allocation [4]. This strategy is designed to be plug-and-play, enabling seamless integration with prior cache eviction methods.

Characterizing the workload patterns of KV caches has also been an area of research. Previous studies have focused on synthetic workloads [5], but there is limited understanding of real-world KV workload patterns. Our work aims to fill this gap by presenting a systematic characterization of KV workload patterns from a leading LLM service provider.

Large language model (LLM) serving has gained significant attention in recent years due to its importance for cloud providers. Caching intermediate results, such as KV$, has been shown to substantially improve serving throughput and latency [1]. However, there is limited understanding of how LLM serving benefits from KV$ caching, particularly in real-world scenarios.

Previous studies have focused on synthetic workloads [2], [3], but these may not accurately reflect the complexities of real-world LLM serving. Our work builds upon these studies by presenting a systematic characterization of KV$ workload patterns from a leading LLM service provider. Our findings highlight the importance of considering real-world workload patterns when designing cache eviction policies.

Recent works have proposed various optimizations for LLM serving, including context caching and disaggregated inference [4]. MemServe, a unified system that integrates both inter-request and intra-request optimizations, has been proposed to manage distributed memory and KV caches across serving instances [5]. However, these works do not provide a thorough characterization of real-world KV$ workload patterns.

Our work complements these studies by providing a detailed analysis of KV$ reuses, reuse time, and probability, and proposing a workload-aware cache eviction policy that improves serving performance under real-world traces.

The importance of efficient caching mechanisms for large language models (LLMs) has been increasingly recognized, given their substantial computational requirements and the need for high-performance serving. Several studies have explored various aspects of caching for LLMs, focusing on strategies to optimize cache utilization and improve serving throughput and latency.

One area of research has concentrated on the development of cache eviction policies tailored for LLMs. For instance, some works have proposed using attention scores to determine which tokens to evict from the cache, aiming to minimize the impact on model performance [1]. However, these methods often rely on local statistics of accumulated attention scores, which may introduce bias [2]. More recent approaches have sought to combine the benefits of different eviction strategies, such as leveraging more accurate attention score statistics and diversified random eviction, to enhance cache efficiency and model performance across various tasks [3].

Characterization of workload patterns in LLM serving has also been a subject of study. While previous research has primarily focused on synthetic workloads, there is a growing recognition of the need to understand real-world workload patterns to inform system design decisions [4]. Observations from actual LLM service providers have highlighted the complexity and variability of KV cache reuses across different requests, emphasizing the importance of workload-aware approaches [5].

The impact of cache size and eviction policies on serving performance has been another critical area of investigation. Studies have shown that the required cache size for an ideal cache hit ratio can vary significantly depending on the workload and the specific characteristics of the requests [6]. This variability underscores the need for adaptive cache management strategies that can adjust to changing workload conditions.

Our work builds on these insights by presenting a systematic characterization of KV workload patterns from a leading LLM service provider and proposing a workload-aware cache eviction policy. This policy aims to improve serving performance under real-world traces, particularly with limited cache capacity.
