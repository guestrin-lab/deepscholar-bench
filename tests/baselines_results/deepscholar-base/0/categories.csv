"AI-driven policy design and analysis has emerged as a crucial area of research, focusing on leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to develop more effective and adaptive policies. One key theme in this category is the application of AI to economic policy design, particularly in addressing issues like taxation and inequality. For instance, the AI Economist \[[Stephan Zheng' 2021-08-05](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02755v1)\] uses a two-level, deep reinforcement learning framework to design optimal tax policies that balance equity and productivity. Similarly, TaxAgent \[[Jizhou Wang' 2025-06-03](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02838v1)\] integrates large language models with agent-based modeling to create adaptive tax policies that account for taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior. Other studies have also explored the use of ML for estimating tax evasion \[[Giovanna Tagliaferri' 2019-12-08](http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03781v3)\] and designing more efficient tax systems. Furthermore, researchers have proposed frameworks for quantifying AI's computational workload \[[Aasish Kumar Sharma' 2025-03-12](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14515v1)\] and evaluating the environmental impact of AI \[[Aasish Kumar Sharma' 2025-03-12](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14515v1)\]. Additionally, AI-driven policy design has been applied to areas like task planning \[[Zirui Zhao' 2023-05-23](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14078v2)\] and policy authoring \[[Michelle S. Lam' 2024-09-26](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18203v1)\]. Overall, these studies demonstrate the potential of AI-driven policy design and analysis to create more effective and adaptive policies that address complex societal challenges.",AI-Driven Policy Design and Analysis
"Agent-based modeling in macroeconomics has been increasingly used to study complex economic systems, allowing researchers to analyze the behavior of heterogeneous agents and their interactions. This approach has been applied to various fields, including the study of economic platforms under shocks \[[Xintong Wang' 2022-03-25](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13395v2)\], heterogeneous agent models with aggregate shocks \[[Jiequn Han' 2021-12-29](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14377v2)\], and the transmission of foreign shocks through households' heterogeneity in access to financial markets \[[Santiago Camara' 2022-01-09](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02916v1)\]. Additionally, agent-based modeling has been used to investigate power distribution in social systems \[[Silvia N. Santalla' 2019-02-08](http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.03288v2)\] and the impact of policy scenarios on the spread of diseases and economic consequences \[[Patrick Mellacher' 2020-11-12](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06289v1)\]. These studies demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of agent-based modeling in capturing the complexities of macroeconomic systems. Furthermore, research has shown that regulatory frameworks, such as taxation policies and platform fee restrictions, can have significant effects on the efficiency, seller diversity, and resilience of economic systems \[[Xintong Wang' 2022-03-25](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13395v2)\]. The use of deep learning-based algorithms, such as DeepHAM, has also improved the solution of high-dimensional heterogeneous agent models \[[Jiequn Han' 2021-12-29](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14377v2)\]. Overall, agent-based modeling has provided valuable insights into the behavior of complex economic systems and the impact of policy interventions.",Agent-Based Modeling in Macroeconomics
"Economic inequality and taxation are intricately linked, with traditional taxation systems often struggling to address issues of regressivity and fairness. Research has shown that property taxation can be particularly regressive, disproportionately affecting lower-valued properties and, by extension, low-income households \[[Ozan Candogan' 2023-12-10](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05996v1)\]. Moreover, the emergence of oligarchs, or individuals holding a significant fraction of a country's wealth, can be influenced by taxation policies, with wealth taxation below a certain threshold potentially leading to their emergence \[[Bruce Boghosian' 2023-08-03](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01500v1)\]. The dynamics of wealth inequality are also affected by household preferences and fiscal policies, with economies converging to egalitarian steady-state equilibria under certain conditions, such as low initial inequality, and fiscal policies like wealth taxes helping to mitigate polarization \[[Kirill Borissov' 2021-07-01](http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00410v1)\]. These findings underscore the need for innovative, data-driven approaches to taxation that can address issues of equity, efficiency, and adaptability, ultimately informing the design of more effective tax policies.",Economic Inequality and Taxation
"Fiscal policy evaluation and simulation is a crucial area of research, focusing on the analysis and optimization of taxation and public expenditure policies. This field encompasses various modeling approaches, including agent-based modeling, which considers the dynamics, space, and individual-level interactions in policy analysis \[[Bernardo Alves Furtado' 2017-12-31](http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00259v1)\]. Researchers have developed models to address debt management problems in stochastic environments \[[Matteo Brachetta' 2021-07-22](http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10491v1)\], design decentralized cross-sector supply chain network models to tackle scarce resource conservation and competition \[[Xiaowei Hu' 2021-01-22](http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.09373v3)\], and investigate the impact of delayed tax revenues on fiscal policy outcomes \[[Mihaela Neamtu' 2005-11-12](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0511322v1)\]. Additionally, studies have examined the effects of tax cuts on macroeconomic variables \[[Masud Alam' 2021-06-21](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10844v1)\] and evaluated the effectiveness of consumption vouchers as fiscal stimulus tools \[[Ming-Huan Liou' 2025-06-02](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01385v1)\]. These contributions highlight the complexity of fiscal policy evaluation and the need for innovative approaches, such as integrating large language models with agent-based modeling, to design adaptive tax policies that balance equity and productivity.",Fiscal Policy Evaluation and Simulation
"Large Language Models in Economic Policy have been increasingly used to analyze and optimize fiscal policies. For instance, a study proposed a framework to systematically identify and rank sectors poised to benefit from India's Union Budget announcements, leveraging a comprehensive corpus of Indian Union Budget transcripts and introducing BASIR, an annotated dataset mapping excerpts from budgetary transcripts to sectoral impacts \[[Sohom Ghosh' 2025-04-02](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13189v1)\]. This framework utilized fine-tuned embeddings for sector identification and language models that ranked sectors based on their predicted performances, achieving a 0.605 F1-score in sector classification and a 0.997 NDCG score in predicting ranks of sectors based on post-budget performances \[[Sohom Ghosh' 2025-04-02](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13189v1)\]. These advancements demonstrate the potential of Large Language Models in economic policy analysis, particularly in evaluating the impact of budget announcements on sector-specific equity performance.",Large Language Models in Economic Policy
"The category of Monetary Policy and Inflation Dynamics is crucial in understanding the interplay between economic activity, intervention, and policy effects. Research in this area highlights the limitations of traditional monetary policy approaches in regulating economic growth and inflation. For instance, studies have shown that the current approach, which focuses on the overall money supply, is insufficient to optimize growth and requires a balanced fiscal policy that considers both consumption and investment loop flows \[[Yaneer Bar-Yam' 2017-10-17](http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06285v2)\]. The importance of expectation anchoring in monetary policy efficacy has also been emphasized, with findings suggesting that the success of monetary policy in curbing inflation is primarily due to its impact on expectations, rather than direct economic effects \[[Max Sina Knicker' 2023-06-02](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01284v4)\]. Furthermore, the relationship between monetary policy, fiscal policy, and inflation dynamics is complex, with factors such as trust in central banks, regulatory policies, and exogenous shocks influencing inflationary dynamics \[[Max Sina Knicker' 2023-06-02](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01284v4)\]. Understanding these dynamics is essential for designing effective policies that balance equity and productivity, and for evaluating the consequences of different monetary and fiscal policy interventions \[[Yaneer Bar-Yam' 2017-10-17](http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06285v2)\]\[[Max Sina Knicker' 2023-06-02](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01284v4)\].",Monetary Policy and Inflation Dynamics
"Optimal taxation theory has been extensively studied, focusing on designing tax policies that balance equity and productivity. Research has shown that international taxation rules are outdated, allowing multinationals to shift profits to tax havens, and tax reforms can significantly impact profit shifting and cross-country welfare \[[Alessandro Ferrari' 2022-11-08](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04388v3)\]. The optimal extraction and taxation of nonrenewable natural resources have also been examined, with studies proving the existence of a Nash equilibrium and deriving optimal extraction and taxation rates \[[Moustapha Pemy' 2016-10-27](http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02547v2)\]. Furthermore, optimal taxation models have been used to study the impact of recursive preferences on taxation, showing that they lead to more progressive taxation \[[Lorenzo Maria Stanca' 2023-04-10](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04599v5)\]. Additionally, researchers have explored the use of taxation to influence social behavior, such as in network routing problems, and have found that any taxation mechanism that improves outcomes on one network must necessarily degrade them on another \[[Philip N. Brown' 2019-11-22](http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.10181v1)\]. Other studies have refined Mirrlees' theory of optimal taxation, introducing new paradigms that consider both total utility maximization and the standard deviation of utility \[[Vassili N. Kolokoltsov' 2024-08-10](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14476v1)\]. These findings highlight the complexity of designing effective tax policies and the need for innovative approaches, such as the integration of large language models with agent-based modeling, to create adaptive tax policies that address taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior \[[Alessandro Ferrari' 2022-11-08](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04388v3)\]\[[Moustapha Pemy' 2016-10-27](http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02547v2)\]\[[Philip N. Brown' 2019-11-22](http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.10181v1)\]\[[Vassili N. Kolokoltsov' 2024-08-10](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14476v1)\]\[[Lorenzo Maria Stanca' 2023-04-10](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04599v5)\].",Optimal Taxation Theory and Applications
