**Economic inequality is a pressing issue that has sparked research into optimal taxation and fiscal policy design**. Various studies have explored the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence in economic policy design, including the AI Economist, which uses two-level deep reinforcement learning to optimize economic policy \[[Stephan Zheng' 2021-08-05](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02755v1)\]. Other research has focused on the impact of taxation on economic growth, inequality, and social welfare \[[Alessandro Ferrari' 2022-11-08](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04388v3)\]\[[Kirill Borissov' 2021-07-01](http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00410v1)\].

Traditional systems, such as the U.S. federal income tax, aim to reduce inequality but often lack adaptability \[[Vassili N. Kolokoltsov' 2024-08-10](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14476v1)\]. In contrast, models like the Saez Optimal Taxation adjust dynamically but fail to account for taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior \[[Vassili N. Kolokoltsov' 2024-08-10](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14476v1)\]. Agent-based modeling (ABM) has been used to study the impact of fiscal policies on economic outcomes, including the effects of taxation on economic growth and inequality \[[Bernardo Alves Furtado' 2017-12-31](http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00259v1)\]\[[Santiago Camara' 2022-01-09](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02916v1)\].

Recent studies have also explored the use of large language models (LLMs) in economic policy design, including the TaxAgent model, which integrates LLMs with ABM to design adaptive tax policies \[[Jizhou Wang' 2025-06-03](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02838v1)\]. Other research has focused on the use of deep learning and reinforcement learning in economic policy design, including the DeepHAM model, which solves high-dimensional heterogeneous agent models with aggregate shocks \[[Jiequn Han' 2021-12-29](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14377v2)\].

The use of simulation frameworks and reinforcement-learning based studies has also been explored in platform economics and taxation \[[Xintong Wang' 2022-03-25](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13395v2)\]. Additionally, research has been conducted on the impact of taxation on congestion, inequality, and economic growth \[[Philip N. Brown' 2019-11-22](http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.10181v1)\]\[[Bruce Boghosian' 2023-08-03](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01500v1)\].

Overall, the literature highlights the need for more adaptive and data-driven approaches to fiscal policy evaluation, such as the TaxAgent model, which offers a novel taxation solution and a scalable framework for fiscal policy evaluation.
