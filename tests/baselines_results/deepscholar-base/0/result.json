Furthermore, the relationship between monetary policy, fiscal policy, and inflation dynamics is complex, with factors such as trust in central banks, regulatory policies, and exogenous shocks influencing inflationary dynamics \\[[Max Sina Knicker' 2023-06-02](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01284v4)\\]. Understanding these dynamics is essential for designing effective policies that balance equity and productivity, and for evaluating the consequences of different monetary and fiscal policy interventions \\[[Yaneer Bar-Yam' 2017-10-17](http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06285v2)\\]\\[[Max Sina Knicker' 2023-06-02](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01284v4)\\].\n|    | paper                                                                                                                      | date     | key idea                                                                                                                                                                                      | main result                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|----|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|  0 | [Preliminary steps toward a universal economic dynamics for monetary and fiscal policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06285v2) | 10/17/17 | The paper explores the relationship between economic activity and intervention, including monetary and fiscal policy, to understand how to optimize economic growth without excess inflation. | The current monetary policy approach is insufficient to regulate economic growth, and optimizing growth requires a balanced fiscal policy that considers both consumption and investment loop flows.                                       |\n|  1 | [Post-COVID Inflation & the Monetary Policy Dilemma: An Agent-Based Scenario Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01284v4)  | 06/02/23 | This paper offers an alternative modelling approach to study the dynamics of inflation during the 2020-2023 period using the Mark-0 Agent-Based Model.                                        | The study finds that the success of monetary policy in curbing inflation is primarily due to expectation anchoring, and that there is a narrow window of optimal policy responses due to the trade-off between inflation and unemployment. |\n### <a id='category-large-language-models-in-economic-policy'></a>Large Language Models in Economic Policy: 1 papers found.\nLarge Language Models in Economic Policy have been increasingly used to analyze and optimize fiscal policies. For instance, a study proposed a framework to systematically identify and rank sectors poised to benefit from India's Union Budget announcements, leveraging a comprehensive corpus of Indian Union Budget transcripts and introducing BASIR, an annotated dataset mapping excerpts from budgetary transcripts to sectoral impacts \\[[Sohom Ghosh' 2025-04-02](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13189v1)\\]. This framework utilized fine-tuned embeddings for sector identification and language models that ranked sectors based on their predicted performances, achieving a 0.605 F1-score in sector classification and a 0.997 NDCG score in predicting ranks of sectors based on post-budget performances \\[[Sohom Ghosh' 2025-04-02](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13189v1)\\]. These advancements demonstrate the potential of Large Language Models in economic policy analysis, particularly in evaluating the impact of budget announcements on sector-specific equity performance.\n|    | paper                                                                                                                                                                       | date     | key idea                                                                                                                               | main result                                                                                                                                             |\n|----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|  0 | [BASIR: Budget-Assisted Sectoral Impact Ranking -- A Dataset for Sector Identification and Performance Prediction Using Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13189v1) | 04/02/25 | This study proposes a framework to systematically identify and rank sectors poised to benefit from India's Union Budget announcements. | The results demonstrate 0.605 F1-score in sector classification, and 0.997 NDCG score in predicting ranks of sectors based on post-budget performances. |\n"
