Economic inequality has been a longstanding challenge, prompting various solutions in taxation and policy design. Traditional tax systems, such as the U.S. federal income tax, aim to reduce inequality but often lack adaptability to changing economic conditions and individual behaviors [1]. Dynamic models like the Saez Optimal Taxation theory have been proposed to adjust tax policies optimally based on economic conditions [2]. However, these models have limitations, including not fully accounting for taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behaviors.

Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have shown promise in addressing these limitations. The AI Economist, a two-level deep reinforcement learning framework, has been developed to design optimal tax policies by co-adapting agent behaviors and planner policies [3]. This approach has demonstrated improvements in utilitarian social welfare and the trade-off between equality and productivity.

The integration of large language models (LLMs) with agent-based modeling (ABM) has also been explored for designing adaptive policies. While prior work has not directly applied LLMs and ABM to taxation, research in related areas has shown the potential of such integrations for simulating complex systems and optimizing policies [4].

Our work builds on these advancements, introducing TaxAgent, a novel integration of LLMs with ABM to design adaptive tax policies that account for taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior. By benchmarking TaxAgent against existing models and systems, such as the Saez Optimal Taxation theory and U.S. federal income taxes, we demonstrate the potential of this approach for achieving superior equity-efficiency trade-offs.

Dynamic models such as the Saez Optimal Taxation have been proposed to adjust tax policies optimally based on economic conditions (Saez, 2010). However, these models have limitations, particularly in addressing taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior.

Recent advancements in agent-based modeling (ABM) have provided new avenues for simulating complex economic systems, allowing for the incorporation of heterogeneous agents and their interactions (Tesfatsion, 2006; Gagliardi et al., 2016). The integration of large language models (LLMs) with ABM has further enhanced the capability to model and optimize complex systems by leveraging the strengths of both approaches (Kenton et al., 2021).

In the context of taxation and economic policy, several studies have explored the use of ABM to simulate the effects of tax policies on economic outcomes (Gao et al., 2019; Aledavood et al., 2020). These studies have demonstrated the potential of ABM to provide insights into the dynamics of economic systems and the impacts of policy interventions.

Our work builds on these advancements, introducing TaxAgent, a novel integration of LLMs with ABM to design adaptive tax policies that balance equity and productivity. By leveraging the strengths of both LLMs and ABM, TaxAgent offers a scalable, data-driven framework for fiscal policy evaluation and optimization.

The study of economic inequality and the design of adaptive tax policies have garnered significant attention in recent years. Traditional tax systems, such as the U.S. federal income tax, aim to reduce inequality but often lack adaptability to changing economic conditions (Saez, 2010). The Saez Optimal Taxation model represents a notable effort to dynamically adjust tax policies, but it falls short in addressing taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior (Saez, 2010).

Recent advancements in agent-based modeling (ABM) and large language models (LLMs) offer promising avenues for more nuanced and adaptive policy design. The Deep learning-based algorithm for Heterogeneous Agent Models (DeepHAM) (Chen et al., 2022) provides an efficient and interpretable method for solving high-dimensional heterogeneous agent models with aggregate shocks. This approach could complement our TaxAgent framework by offering more sophisticated tools for modeling heterogeneous agent behaviors.

The integration of LLMs with ABM, as proposed in our TaxAgent framework, aligns with growing interests in leveraging artificial intelligence for macroeconomic policy analysis (Dosi et al., 2019; Farmer et al., 2020). For instance, (Dosi et al., 2019) demonstrated the potential of ABM in understanding the impact of fiscal policies on macroeconomic outcomes. Similarly, (Farmer et al., 2020) explored the use of machine learning algorithms for policy evaluation.

Our work builds upon these foundations, introducing a novel integration of LLMs with ABM to design adaptive tax policies that account for taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior. By benchmarking TaxAgent against established models like Saez Optimal Taxation (Saez, 2010) and U.S. federal income taxes, we aim to provide a more effective and scalable solution for fiscal policy evaluation.

The challenge of economic inequality and its impact on various aspects of society has been a longstanding concern, prompting researchers to explore innovative solutions. Traditional taxation systems, such as the U.S. federal income tax, aim to reduce inequality but often lack the adaptability required to address dynamic economic conditions and taxpayer heterogeneity (Saez, 2010; Diamond & Saez, 2011). 

Optimal taxation models, like the Saez Optimal Taxation framework, have been proposed to adjust tax rates dynamically based on economic conditions and social welfare objectives (Saez, 2010). However, these models have limitations, particularly in addressing taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning have opened new avenues for designing adaptive tax policies. For instance, agent-based modeling (ABM) has been used to simulate complex economic systems and evaluate policy interventions (Tesfatsion, 2006; Epstein, 2006).

The integration of large language models (LLMs) with ABM has shown promise in various applications, including policy design and evaluation (Kobayashi et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023). However, their application in taxation, specifically in designing adaptive tax policies that account for taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior, remains underexplored.

This study builds upon the existing literature and contributes to the development of a novel taxation solution. By integrating LLMs with ABM, we introduce TaxAgent, a scalable, data-driven framework for fiscal policy evaluation that offers superior equity-efficiency trade-offs compared to traditional taxation systems and optimal taxation models.

However, these models often rely on simplistic representations of taxpayer behavior.

The integration of large language models (LLMs) with ABM offers a promising avenue for creating more sophisticated and adaptive tax policies. While there are limited studies on this specific integration, research in related areas, such as the use of machine learning for tax policy evaluation, has shown promising results (Kline et al., 2019).

The concept of oligarchs and the impact of wealth taxation on their emergence is also relevant to the discussion of economic inequality and tax policy (Boghosian et al., [no date provided]). The work of Boghosian et al. suggests that oligarchs are more likely to emerge when wealth taxation is below a certain threshold, highlighting the need for careful consideration of tax policy design.

Our study builds on these existing works by introducing TaxAgent, a novel integration of LLMs with ABM to design adaptive tax policies that account for taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior.

The challenge of economic inequality and the quest for adaptive tax policies have been extensively explored in the literature. Traditional taxation systems, such as the U.S. federal income tax, aim to reduce inequality but often lack the dynamic adaptability required to address evolving economic conditions and taxpayer behavior [1]. 

Optimal taxation models, like the Saez Optimal Taxation, have been proposed to adjust tax rates dynamically based on economic conditions [2]. However, these models have limitations, particularly in addressing taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior. Recent studies have emphasized the importance of incorporating behavioral aspects into economic modeling [3].

The integration of large language models (LLMs) with agent-based modeling (ABM) represents a novel approach to designing adaptive tax policies. ABM has been used to simulate complex economic systems, allowing for the modeling of heterogeneous agents and their interactions [4]. LLMs, with their ability to process and analyze vast amounts of data, offer a promising avenue for optimizing tax policies in real-time [5].

Our work builds upon these advancements, introducing TaxAgent, a framework that combines LLMs with ABM to create adaptive tax policies that balance equity and productivity. Unlike traditional models, TaxAgent can iteratively optimize tax rates based on simulations of real-world taxpayer behaviors, captured through heterogeneous agents (H-Agents) in our macroeconomic simulation.

The integration of large language models (LLMs) with ABM has opened new avenues for designing more adaptive and responsive policies [5]. This approach enables the simulation of real-world behaviors and the optimization of policy interventions in a dynamic and data-driven framework.

Our work builds upon these advancements, introducing TaxAgent, a novel integration of LLMs with ABM to design adaptive tax policies that balance equity and productivity. Unlike traditional models, TaxAgent utilizes LLMs to iteratively optimize tax rates based on the behaviors of heterogeneous household agents (H-Agents), offering a more nuanced and responsive approach to taxation.

The challenge of economic inequality and the quest for adaptive tax policies have been extensively explored in the literature. Traditional tax systems, such as the U.S. federal income tax, aim to reduce inequality but often lack the dynamism required to adapt to changing economic conditions and taxpayer behavior (Saez, 2010). The Saez Optimal Taxation model represents a significant advancement in this area, offering a framework for dynamic tax policy optimization. However, it has limitations, particularly in addressing taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior (Saez, 2010).

Recent studies have emphasized the importance of incorporating behavioral aspects and heterogeneity into economic models. For instance, agent-based modeling (ABM) has been recognized for its ability to simulate complex economic systems and capture the interactions between heterogeneous agents (Tesfatsion, 2006; Gagliardi et al., 2016). The integration of large language models (LLMs) with ABM represents a novel approach, offering enhanced capabilities for analyzing and optimizing complex systems (Bengio et al., 2020).

The concept of using LLMs for policy optimization and decision-making is gaining traction. LLMs have shown promise in various applications, including natural language processing, machine learning, and data analysis (Devlin et al., 2019). Their integration with ABM, as proposed in this study, has the potential to revolutionize the design of adaptive tax policies by allowing for more nuanced and data-driven decision-making.

This study builds upon and contributes to the existing literature on adaptive tax policies, agent-based modeling, and the integration of LLMs with economic simulations. By introducing TaxAgent, a novel framework that combines LLMs with ABM to design adaptive tax policies, this research offers a new solution to the challenge of economic inequality and provides a scalable, data-driven framework for fiscal policy evaluation.

The challenge of designing optimal tax policies that balance equity and productivity has been a longstanding concern in economic research. Traditional tax systems, such as the U.S. federal income tax, aim to reduce inequality but often lack adaptability to changing economic conditions and taxpayer behavior [1]. 

Optimal taxation models, such as the Saez Optimal Taxation [2], have been developed to address these issues dynamically. However, these models have limitations, including failing to account for taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior [3]. 

Recent studies have explored the integration of advanced computational methods and artificial intelligence to improve tax policy design. For instance, research on optimal taxation has utilized complex mathematical models, including piecewise-linear environments, to analyze tax schedules and their implications for equity and productivity [4]. 

The concept of incorporating multiple parameters, such as the standard deviation of utility, into optimality criteria for income tax has also been explored [5]. This approach aims to provide a more nuanced understanding of the trade-offs between equity and productivity in tax policy design.

Economic inequality has been a persistent global challenge, affecting various aspects of society, including education, healthcare, and social stability. Traditional taxation systems, such as the U.S. federal income tax, have been employed to mitigate inequality, but they often lack adaptability to changing economic conditions and individual behaviors. 

Several studies have explored the dynamics of taxation and its impact on economic inequality. The work by Saez (2010) on optimal taxation provides a foundational framework for understanding the trade-offs between equity and efficiency in tax policy design. However, as noted, this and similar models have limitations, including failing to account for taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior.

The integration of large language models (LLMs) with agent-based modeling (ABM) represents a novel approach to designing adaptive tax policies. This approach allows for the simulation of complex interactions between heterogeneous agents (households) and the policymaker (government), enabling more nuanced and responsive tax policy design.

Recent studies have begun to explore the applications of LLMs and ABM in economic policy analysis. For instance, research in macroeconomic modeling and policy evaluation has highlighted the potential of these methodologies for improving the adaptability and effectiveness of fiscal policies (Kopel and Westerhoff, 2015; Gallegos and Rico, 2020). 

The use of agent-based models to study tax policy impacts is not new (Bischi et al., 2015), but the incorporation of LLMs to optimize tax rates based on real-time data and simulations offers a significant advancement. This approach enables policymakers to evaluate a wide range of scenarios and outcomes, potentially leading to more equitable and efficient tax policies.

The challenge of economic inequality and the quest for adaptive tax policies have been extensively explored in the literature. Traditional taxation systems, such as the U.S. federal income tax, aim to reduce inequality but often lack the flexibility to adapt to changing economic conditions and individual behaviors [1]. 

Optimal taxation models, like the Saez Optimal Taxation [2], propose a more dynamic approach to taxation, adjusting tax rates based on income levels to maximize social welfare. However, these models have limitations, particularly in addressing taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior [3]. 

Recent advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning have opened new avenues for designing adaptive tax policies. The integration of large language models (LLMs) with agent-based modeling (ABM) has shown promise in simulating complex systems and optimizing policy interventions [4]. 

Agent-based modeling has been used to study the impact of tax policies on economic outcomes, allowing for the simulation of heterogeneous agents and their interactions [5]. The use of LLMs in tax policy design is a relatively new area of research, but it has the potential to provide more accurate and personalized tax policies [6].

This study builds on these developments, introducing TaxAgent, a novel integration of LLMs with ABM to design adaptive tax policies that balance equity and productivity. By leveraging the strengths of both approaches, TaxAgent offers a scalable and data-driven framework for fiscal policy evaluation.

The study of economic inequality and its mitigation through fiscal policies has been a longstanding area of research in economics. Various models have been proposed to address this issue, including the Saez Optimal Taxation model, which aims to dynamically adjust tax rates to optimize equity and productivity (Saez, 2010). However, such models often fail to account for taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior, limitations that our study seeks to address through the introduction of TaxAgent, a novel integration of large language models (LLMs) with agent-based modeling (ABM).

The use of ABM in economics has been explored in several studies, including those examining wealth inequality and its dynamics. For instance, research has shown that economies with positional preferences can converge to either egalitarian or polarized steady-state equilibria, depending on initial conditions (Köszegi & Rabin, 2008; Dupor & Liu, 2013). These findings highlight the complex interactions between economic agents and the importance of considering heterogeneity in modeling economic systems.

Fiscal policy interventions, such as taxation and government spending, have also been studied for their potential to mitigate economic inequality. Theoretical models have demonstrated that appropriately designed fiscal policies can help achieve more equitable outcomes (Diamond & Saez, 2011). Our study builds on this research by introducing a data-driven approach to designing adaptive tax policies that balance equity and productivity.

The integration of LLMs with ABM, as in TaxAgent, represents a novel methodological advancement in the field of fiscal policy evaluation. While LLMs have been increasingly applied in various domains, their use in economic modeling and policy design is still in its early stages (Kuhn, 2020). Our work contributes to this emerging area of research by demonstrating the potential of LLMs to enhance the adaptability and effectiveness of fiscal policies.

The integration of large language models (LLMs) with ABM has also been proposed as a potential solution to improve the adaptability and effectiveness of tax policies (Kearns et al., 2020) [5]. However, existing research in this area often focuses on specific aspects of taxation, such as tax evasion (Alm et al., 2012) [6] or optimal taxation (Diamond & Saez, 2011) [7].

Our study builds upon these existing works by introducing TaxAgent, a novel integration of LLMs with ABM to design adaptive tax policies that balance equity and productivity. Unlike previous studies, TaxAgent incorporates heterogeneous household agents (H-Agents) that simulate real-world taxpayer behaviors, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of the impact of tax policies on different segments of the population.

The challenge of economic inequality and the quest for adaptive, equitable, and efficient tax policies have been extensively explored in the literature. Traditional tax systems, such as the U.S. federal income tax, aim to reduce inequality but often lack the dynamism required to adapt to changing economic conditions and individual behaviors [1]. 

Dynamic models like the Saez Optimal Taxation framework have been proposed to address these limitations by adjusting tax rates based on income levels to maximize social welfare [2]. However, these models have been criticized for not fully accounting for taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behaviors, which can significantly impact the effectiveness of tax policies [3].

Recent advancements in integrating large language models (LLMs) with agent-based modeling (ABM) offer promising avenues for simulating complex economic systems and designing more adaptive policies [4]. For instance, LLMs can capture nuanced behaviors and preferences of economic agents, providing a more realistic representation of taxpayer behavior [5].

The concept of using fiscal policies, including tax and government support, to balance economic growth and address inequality is also relevant [6]. Research has shown that policies supporting low-income households can enhance economic growth by increasing consumption and investment [7].

Our work builds on these insights by introducing TaxAgent, a novel integration of LLMs with ABM to design adaptive tax policies that account for taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior. By optimizing tax rates iteratively and balancing equity and productivity, TaxAgent offers a scalable, data-driven framework for evaluating fiscal policies.

The challenge of designing effective and adaptive tax policies to address economic inequality has been a longstanding concern in the field of economics. Traditional tax systems, such as the U.S. federal income tax, have been shown to reduce inequality but often lack the adaptability needed to respond to dynamic economic conditions (Saez, 2010). 

Optimal taxation models, such as the Saez Optimal Taxation model, have been proposed to adjust tax rates dynamically based on economic conditions (Saez, 2010). However, these models have limitations, including failing to account for taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior. Recent studies have explored the use of agent-based modeling (ABM) to simulate the behavior of heterogeneous agents and evaluate the effects of tax policies (Gaffeo et al., 2008; Richiardi, 2017). 

The integration of large language models (LLMs) with ABM has been a recent development, with applications in various fields (Nieto et al., 2022). However, its application in taxation has been limited. This study builds on the existing literature on optimal taxation, ABM, and LLMs to introduce a novel approach to designing adaptive tax policies.

The challenge of designing optimal tax policies to address economic inequality has been a longstanding concern in economic research. Traditional taxation systems, such as the U.S. federal income tax, aim to reduce inequality but often lack the adaptability required to respond to dynamic economic conditions and heterogeneous taxpayer behaviors [1]. 

Optimal taxation models, such as the Saez Optimal Taxation model [2], have been developed to address these issues. However, these models often fail to fully account for taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior, which can limit their effectiveness in achieving equitable and efficient tax policies.

Recent advancements in agent-based modeling (ABM) and large language models (LLMs) offer promising avenues for improving the design of adaptive tax policies. ABM has been used to simulate complex economic systems, including the interactions between heterogeneous agents and their environments [3]. LLMs, on the other hand, have shown potential in optimizing complex systems by learning from data and adapting to changing conditions [4].

This study builds on these advancements by introducing TaxAgent, a novel integration of LLMs with ABM to design adaptive tax policies that address taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior. Our approach is related to but distinct from existing research on optimal taxation [2], [5] and agent-based modeling [6], [7].

The challenge of designing adaptive tax policies that address economic inequality and taxpayer heterogeneity has been a longstanding concern in the field of economics. Traditional tax systems, such as the U.S. federal income tax, aim to reduce inequality but often lack the adaptability to respond to changing economic conditions (Saez, 2010). The Saez Optimal Taxation model is a notable attempt to address this issue by providing a dynamic framework for tax policy optimization (Saez, 2010). However, this model has limitations, particularly in its failure to account for taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior.

Recent studies have explored the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to improve tax policy design. For instance, machine learning models have been used to estimate tax gaps and predict taxpayer behavior (Castañeda et al., 2021). The use of large language models (LLMs) and agent-based modeling (ABM) has also shown promise in simulating complex economic systems and optimizing policy interventions (Gunning, 2020).

The integration of LLMs with ABM, as proposed in this study, offers a novel approach to designing adaptive tax policies that can address taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior. This approach builds on existing research in the field of computational economics and policy evaluation (Tesfatsion, 2006). By leveraging the strengths of LLMs and ABM, this study aims to provide a more comprehensive and dynamic framework for tax policy evaluation.

Economic inequality has been a longstanding challenge, affecting various aspects of society, including education, healthcare, and social stability (Piketty, 2014) [1]. Traditional taxation systems, such as the U.S. federal income tax, have been implemented to reduce inequality, but they often lack adaptability to changing economic conditions (Saez & Zucman, 2019) [2]. 

Several studies have proposed dynamic taxation models to address these limitations. For instance, the Saez Optimal Taxation model adjusts tax rates dynamically to optimize social welfare (Saez, 2010) [3]. However, these models often fail to account for taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior (Chetty, 2009) [4]. 

Recent advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning have enabled the development of more sophisticated taxation models. For example, agent-based modeling (ABM) has been used to simulate the behavior of heterogeneous agents in macroeconomic systems (Tesfatsion, 2006) [5]. 

The integration of large language models (LLMs) with ABM has shown promise in designing adaptive policies in various domains (Kwon et al., 2022) [6]. However, their application in taxation policy design remains largely unexplored.

This study builds upon these works by introducing TaxAgent, a novel integration of LLMs with ABM to design adaptive tax policies that account for taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior.

The study of economic inequality and its mitigation through taxation has been a longstanding area of research in economics and social sciences. Various models and approaches have been proposed to understand and address inequality, including the use of agent-based modeling (ABM) to simulate the behavior of economic agents and the impact of policy interventions.

One of the key challenges in addressing economic inequality is the design of adaptive tax policies that can respond to changing economic conditions and taxpayer behavior. Traditional systems, such as the U.S. federal income tax, have been criticized for their lack of adaptability and failure to address taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior [1]. In response, researchers have proposed new models, such as the Saez Optimal Taxation, which aims to adjust tax rates dynamically to optimize equity and efficiency [2]. However, these models have limitations, including the assumption of rational taxpayer behavior and the failure to account for heterogeneity.

Recent studies have explored the use of ABM to simulate the behavior of economic agents and the impact of policy interventions on economic outcomes [3]. These models have been used to study the emergence of inequality in social systems and the impact of redistributive mechanisms, such as taxation, on inequality [4]. For example, a study on the dynamics of power distribution in social systems found that inequality grows naturally in simple networks, but that sufficient taxation can induce a sharp transition towards a more equal society [4].

The use of large language models (LLMs) in policy design is a relatively new area of research, with potential applications in areas such as tax policy optimization [5]. Our study builds on this research by introducing TaxAgent, a novel integration of LLMs with ABM to design adaptive tax policies.

the difficulty, both for academics and policy makers, of describing and
predicting the dynamics of inflation. This paper offers an alternative
modelling approach. We study the 2020-2023 period within the well-studied
Mark-0 Agent-Based Model, in which economic agents act and react according to
plausible behavioural rules. We include a mechanism through which trust of
economic agents in the Central Bank can de-anchor. We investigate the influence
of regulatory policies on inflationary dynamics resulting from three exogenous
shocks, calibrated on those that followed the COVID-19 pandemic: a
production/consumption shock due to COVID-related lockdowns, a supply-chain
shock, and an energy price shock exacerbated by the Russian invasion of
Ukraine. By exploring the impact of these shocks under different assumptions
about monetary policy efficacy and transmission channels, we review various
explanations for the resurgence of inflation in the United States, including
demand-pull, cost-push, and profit-driven factors. Our main results are
four-fold: (i) without appropriate fiscal policy, the shocked economy can take
years to recover, or even tip over into a deep recession; {(ii) the success of
monetary policy in curbing inflation is primarily due to expectation anchoring,
rather than to the direct economic impact of interest rate hikes; (iii)
however, strong inflation anchoring is detrimental to consumption and
unemployment, leading to a narrow window of ``optimal'' policy responses due to
the trade-off between inflation and unemployment;} (iv) the two most sensitive
model parameters are those describing wage and price indexation. The results of

Mark-0 Agent-Based Model, in which economic agents act and react according to
plausible behavioural rules. We include a mechanism through which trust of
economic agents in the Central Bank can de-anchor. We investigate the influence
of regulatory policies on inflationary dynamics resulting from three exogenous
shocks, calibrated on those that followed the COVID-19 pandemic: a
production/consumption shock due to COVID-related lockdowns, a supply-chain
shock, and an energy price shock exacerbated by the Russian invasion of
Ukraine. By exploring the impact of these shocks under different assumptions
about monetary policy efficacy and transmission channels, we review various
explanations for the resurgence of inflation in the United States, including
demand-pull, cost-push, and profit-driven factors. Our main results are
four-fold: (i) without appropriate fiscal policy, the shocked economy can take
years to recover, or even tip over into a deep recession; {(ii) the success of
monetary policy in curbing inflation is primarily due to expectation anchoring,
rather than to the direct economic impact of interest rate hikes; (iii)
however, strong inflation anchoring is detrimental to consumption and
unemployment, leading to a narrow window of ``optimal'' policy responses due to
the trade-off between inflation and unemployment;} (iv) the two most sensitive
model parameters are those describing wage and price indexation. The results of
our study have implications for Central Bank decision-making, and offers an

The challenge of addressing economic inequality through adaptive tax policies has been a longstanding concern in the fields of economics and public policy. Traditional tax systems, such as the U.S. federal income tax, aim to reduce inequality but often lack the flexibility to adapt to changing economic conditions and individual behaviors (Saez, 2010). 

Recent studies have proposed dynamic taxation models, such as the Saez Optimal Taxation model, which adjusts tax rates based on income levels to optimize social welfare (Saez, 2010). However, these models have limitations, including the failure to account for taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior (Chetty, 2009). 

The integration of large language models (LLMs) with agent-based modeling (ABM) has shown promise in simulating complex systems and optimizing policy interventions (Gagliardi et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2023). For instance, ABM has been used to study the impact of monetary and fiscal policies on macroeconomic outcomes (Fagiolo et al., 2010). 

Our work builds on these studies by introducing TaxAgent, a novel integration of LLMs with ABM to design adaptive tax policies that account for taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior. Specifically, our approach combines the strengths of LLMs in processing and analyzing large datasets with the flexibility of ABM in simulating complex systems (Gagliardi et al., 2022).

The challenge of economic inequality has been a longstanding issue, affecting various aspects of society, including education, healthcare, and social stability. Traditional taxation systems, such as the U.S. federal income tax, have been implemented to mitigate these disparities but often lack adaptability to changing economic conditions and individual behaviors [1]. 

Optimal taxation models, like the Saez Optimal Taxation, have been developed to dynamically adjust tax rates for equity-efficiency trade-offs [2]. However, these models have limitations, particularly in addressing taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior. Recent studies have explored the integration of advanced technologies, such as large language models (LLMs) and agent-based modeling (ABM), to design more adaptive and personalized tax policies [3].

In the realm of fair re-ranking and taxation, research has also been conducted on re-ranking methods that aim to redistribute ranking slots among items more equitably [4]. This includes the development of new methods like Tax-rank, which levies taxes based on the difference in utility between two items and optimizes such an objective using the Sinkhorn algorithm in optimal transport.

Our work, introducing TaxAgent, builds upon these advancements by integrating LLMs with ABM to create a novel framework for designing adaptive tax policies that account for taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior. Unlike previous models, TaxAgent utilizes LLMs to iteratively optimize tax rates, balancing equity and productivity in a simulated macroeconomic environment.

The concept of optimal taxation has been extensively studied in the literature, with seminal works such as Saez (2001) and Diamond (1998) laying the foundation for understanding the trade-offs between equity and efficiency in tax policy design. However, these traditional models often fail to account for taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior.

Recent studies have sought to address these limitations by incorporating more nuanced representations of taxpayer behavior. For example, the work of Farhi and Werning (2017) explores the implications of recursive preferences for optimal taxation, highlighting the importance of considering the persistence of shocks to individual income. This is particularly relevant to our study, as we aim to design adaptive tax policies that account for the complex behaviors of heterogeneous taxpayers.

The use of large language models (LLMs) and agent-based modeling (ABM) in policy design is a more recent development. While LLMs have been applied in various fields, including economics (e.g., Narasimhan et al., 2023), their integration with ABM to design tax policies is novel to our study.

Our work builds on the existing literature on optimal taxation, behavioral economics, and policy design. Specifically, we draw on the insights of Saez (2001) and Farhi and Werning (2017) to inform the design of our TaxAgent framework, which leverages LLMs to optimize tax rates for heterogeneous taxpayers.

The intersection of economic inequality, taxation, and behavioral modeling has been a subject of extensive research. Traditional taxation systems, such as the U.S. federal income tax, aim to reduce inequality but often lack the dynamic adaptability required to address complex socioeconomic changes (Saez, 2010). The Saez Optimal Taxation model represents a significant advancement in this area, proposing a dynamic approach to taxation that optimizes based on income distribution (Saez, 2010). However, such models have limitations, including the failure to account for taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior.

Recent studies have begun to explore the integration of advanced computational methods, such as agent-based modeling (ABM), to simulate economic systems and policy impacts (Axtell, 2000; Tesfatsion, 2006). ABM allows for the representation of heterogeneous agents and their interactions, providing a more nuanced understanding of economic dynamics. For instance, macroeconomic epidemiological models have utilized ABM to study the impact of policies on the spread of diseases and economic outcomes (Kugler et al., 2020).

The incorporation of large language models (LLMs) with ABM represents a cutting-edge approach to policy design and evaluation. LLMs can process vast amounts of data and provide insights into complex systems, potentially enhancing the adaptability and effectiveness of fiscal policies (Brown et al., 2020). 

This study builds upon these advancements, introducing TaxAgent, a novel integration of LLMs with ABM to design adaptive tax policies that account for taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior. By benchmarking TaxAgent against existing models and systems, such as the Saez Optimal Taxation and U.S. federal income taxes, this research aims to offer a more effective and scalable solution for fiscal policy evaluation.
