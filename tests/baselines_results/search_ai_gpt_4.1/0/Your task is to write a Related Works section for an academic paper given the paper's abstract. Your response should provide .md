The challenge of designing effective tax policy that balances both equity and economic efficiency traces back to the classical optimal income taxation frameworks established in economic literature. The foundational models, such as those of Mirrlees and Saez, have undergone significant refinement. Recent developments propose incorporating utility variance and analogies with portfolio optimization for transparent, progressive optimal taxation [4]. Analytic extensions have examined the welfare-maximizing properties of flat taxes on labor, capital, and consumption, particularly under uncertain investment returns, as exemplified by studies on the Domar-Musgrave effect [1]. Meanwhile, multidimensional approaches further generalize optimal policy analyses, taking into account heterogeneity in skills and behaviors to derive global optimal tax formulas [14].

Wealth inequality and the effect of taxation have been a focal point within the modeling literature. Ordinary differential equation (ODE) and kinetic models demonstrate that neither income nor capital gains taxation alone suffices to curb wealth concentration unless set above critical thresholds, drawing implications for wealth tax design and redistribution strategies [10][22]. Similarly, research has identified the parameters necessary for both achieving growth-optimal tax rates and addressing persistent inequality, with stylized models elucidating the sectorial trade-offs inherent to these decisions [20].

On the computational side, recent years have witnessed the advent of large language models (LLMs) and agent-based modeling (ABM) in economic policy design. The AI Economist framework, which uses two-level deep reinforcement learning, allows both agents and a social planner to co-adapt their behaviors, producing improved policy outcomes in simulated tax environments [1]. Further, frameworks leveraging multiple LLMs as heterogeneous agents simulate the effects of interventions such as interest-income taxation, harnessing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs for nuanced policy evaluation [2]. Agent-based simulations combining LLMs and reinforcement learning have also been applied to examine taxpayer compliance, the endogenous emergence of tax evasion, and the impacts of enforcement and public goods provision [3]. Other works have explored the feasibility of using LLMs in financial markets as trading agents, highlighting the potential of such systems to model economic dynamics relevant to regulatory and fiscal policy [4]. Additionally, there is growing interest in LLM-driven agentic workflows for empirical economic analysis and policy evaluation, often integrating human oversight to ensure interpretability and accountability [5].

The intersection of agent-based models, LLMs, and optimal taxation is consequently an emerging and promising research area. This literature review highlights the limitations of traditional analytic approaches in addressing heterogeneity and behavioral complexity, while demonstrating how AI-driven methods—particularly those involving LLMs and ABMs—can offer data-driven, adaptive, and scalable solutions for fiscal policy. The proposed TaxAgent, which merges these paradigms, builds directly on these theoretical and computational advancements, and represents a substantial contribution to ongoing efforts in taxation and policy optimization.
