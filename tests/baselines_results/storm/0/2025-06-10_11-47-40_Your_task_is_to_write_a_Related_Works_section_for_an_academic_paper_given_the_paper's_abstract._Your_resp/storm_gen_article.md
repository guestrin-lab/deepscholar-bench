Economic inequality is a pressing global issue, affecting education, healthcare, and social stability. Various studies have explored the impact of taxation on inequality, with traditional systems like the U.S. federal income tax aiming to reduce disparities [1]. However, these systems often lack adaptability and fail to account for taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior.
Recent research has proposed more dynamic approaches to taxation, such as the Saez Optimal Taxation model [2]. While this model adjusts tax rates based on economic conditions, it does not fully capture the complexities of taxpayer behavior. In contrast, agent-based modeling (ABM) has been used to simulate the behavior of heterogeneous agents in various economic contexts [3][4]. For instance, ABM has been applied to study the effects of tax evasion on economic systems [2].
The integration of large language models (LLMs) with ABM has shown promise in enhancing the adaptability and effectiveness of economic policies [5]. LLMs have been used to automate content generation and improve the efficiency of research workflows [5][6]. In the context of taxation, LLMs can be leveraged to analyze taxpayer behavior and optimize tax policies [7].
Several studies have explored the impact of taxation on economic systems, including the effects of international taxation on business entities [7]. Others have examined the role of management information systems in tax collection and payment processes [8]. The use of LLMs in taxation has also been explored, including the generation of explanations for tax refund decisions [6].
This study builds on these works by introducing TaxAgent, a novel integration of LLMs with ABM to design adaptive tax policies. Our approach combines the strengths of LLMs in analyzing complex data with the flexibility of ABM in simulating heterogeneous agent behavior. By benchmarking TaxAgent against existing taxation systems, including the Saez Optimal Taxation model and U.S. federal income taxes, we demonstrate the potential of our approach to achieve superior equity-efficiency trade-offs.
