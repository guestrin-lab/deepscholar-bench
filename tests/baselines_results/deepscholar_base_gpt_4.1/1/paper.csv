The importance of caching intermediate results, such as key-value (KV) pairs, in serving large language models (LLMs) has been increasingly recognized [1]. Caching KV pairs can substantially improve serving throughput and latency by avoiding redundant computations [2]. However, designing efficient cache eviction policies for LLM serving remains a challenge due to the complex and workload-dependent nature of KV pair reuses.

Several studies have explored cache eviction methods for LLMs. For instance, query-aware KV eviction methods have been proposed to optimize cache performance for specific queries [3]. However, these methods may suffer from performance degradation under multi-query scenarios, even at high cache budget ratios. In contrast, query-agnostic methods, such as KVzip [4], have shown promising results in reducing KV cache sizes and attention latency without significant performance loss.

Characterizing KV workload patterns is crucial for designing effective cache eviction policies. Previous studies have focused on synthetic workloads [5], but recent work has highlighted the importance of understanding real-world KV workload patterns [6]. Our work builds on these findings, presenting a systematic characterization of KV workload patterns from a leading LLM service provider.

Our characterization reveals that KV reuses are skewed across requests, with reuses between single-turn requests being equally important as multi-turn requests [6]. Additionally, the reuse time and probability exhibit diversity across all requests, but tend to be predictable within specific request categories. These observations inform the design of workload-aware cache eviction policies.

Workload-aware cache eviction policies have been explored in various contexts [7][8]. For example, some studies have proposed policies that adapt to changing workload patterns [9]. Our work proposes a similar approach, leveraging insights from our characterization to improve serving performance under real-world traces, particularly with limited cache capacity.

**Related Works Section:**

The efficient serving of large language models (LLMs) has become a critical issue due to their substantial computational requirements. One of the key strategies to mitigate these costs is through the optimization of KV cache mechanisms. The KV cache technique significantly improves generation speed but at the cost of considerable memory consumption, particularly in long-context scenarios [1]. Various methods have been proposed to address the challenge of managing KV cache effectively. 

Existing KV cache eviction methods often result in performance degradation in long-context scenarios due to information loss [1]. In contrast, our work focuses on characterizing KV workload patterns to inform the design of more effective cache eviction policies. This approach aligns with recent studies highlighting the importance of workload-aware strategies in optimizing cache performance [2].

Recent studies have also explored novel approaches to KV cache management. For instance, the KVMerger approach proposes a merging strategy to achieve adaptive KV cache compression without significant performance degradation [1]. Such innovative strategies underscore the evolving landscape of KV cache optimization, from eviction policies to merging and compression techniques.

Further details on cache eviction policies and their impact on LLM serving performance can be found in [1]. The characterization of KV workload patterns and the proposal of workload-aware cache eviction policies have also been explored [2].

The increasing demand for efficient serving of large language models (LLMs) has led to a focus on optimizing caching strategies for intermediate results, particularly key-value (KV) cache. Our work builds upon previous research in this area, aiming to improve serving throughput and latency.

In contrast, our work focuses on characterizing KV workload patterns from a leading LLM service provider, revealing insights into reuse patterns and cache eviction policies.

Characterizing KV workload patterns is crucial for designing effective cache eviction policies. Previous studies have primarily focused on synthetic workloads [2][3]. However, our analysis of real-world traces reveals nuanced patterns, including skewed KV reuses across requests and diverse reuse times and probabilities. These findings align with [4], which highlights the importance of considering real-world workload patterns in cache design.

Cache eviction policies have been extensively studied in the context of LLMs. Some works propose using traditional cache eviction policies, such as LRU (Least Recently Used) or FIFO (First-In-First-Out) [5]. However, these policies may not be optimal for LLM serving, as they do not account for the unique characteristics of KV workloads. Our proposed workload-aware cache eviction policy addresses this limitation, improving serving performance under real-world traces, especially with limited cache capacity.

Recent works have also explored the use of clustering and semantic-based approaches for KV cache compression [1]. For example, ClusterKV [1] recalls tokens at the granularity of semantic clusters, achieving negligible accuracy loss and improved inference efficiency. Our work complements these efforts, focusing on characterizing KV workload patterns and designing a workload-aware cache eviction policy.

The importance of caching intermediate results, such as key-value (KV) pairs, in serving large language models (LLMs) has been increasingly recognized [1]. Caching KV pairs can substantially improve serving throughput and latency by avoiding redundant computations [2]. However, designing efficient cache eviction policies for LLMs is challenging due to the complex and dynamic nature of their workloads.

Several studies have explored cache eviction strategies for LLMs. For instance, some approaches focus on evicting KV pairs based on their importance, which can be determined by factors such as attention mechanisms [3] or token reuse patterns [4]. Other works have proposed using machine learning-based methods to predict the likelihood of KV pair reuse [5].

Despite these efforts, there is limited understanding of how LLM serving benefits from KV caching in real-world scenarios. Previous studies often rely on synthetic workloads, which may not accurately reflect the complexities of actual LLM serving environments [6]. Our work aims to fill this gap by presenting a systematic characterization of KV workload patterns from a leading LLM service provider.

Our characterization reveals that KV reuses are skewed across requests, with reuses between single-turn requests being equally important as multi-turn requests [7]. We also observe that the reuse time and probability are diverse across all requests, but predictable for specific request categories. These findings have important implications for the design of cache eviction policies.

Recent works have proposed various cache eviction policies for LLMs, including those that adapt to changing workload patterns [8] and those that prioritize KV pairs based on their importance [9]. However, these policies often rely on idealized assumptions about the workload patterns, which may not hold in practice.

In contrast, our proposed workload-aware cache eviction policy takes into account the complex and dynamic nature of real-world LLM workloads. By leveraging our characterization of KV workload patterns, our policy can improve serving performance under real-world traces, especially with limited cache capacity.

The importance of efficient serving of large language models (LLMs) has been increasingly recognized, with caching intermediate results (KV$) being a crucial technique for improving serving throughput and latency [1]. Previous studies have explored various aspects of KV$ caching, including cache eviction policies, which are highly workload-dependent.

Characterization of KV$ workload patterns has been an area of active research. While some studies have focused on synthetic workloads [2], others have analyzed real-world traces to draw insights into KV$ reuse patterns [1]. Our work builds on these efforts, providing a systematic characterization of KV$ workload patterns from a leading LLM service provider.

The impact of cache eviction policies on LLM serving performance has also been investigated. Some studies have proposed novel eviction policies, such as the Attention-Gate approach, which injects a lightweight module into the model to dynamically evict KV$ states [3]. Other works have explored workload-aware cache eviction policies, which adapt to changing workload patterns to optimize serving performance [1].

The benefits of caching in LLM serving have been widely recognized, with some studies demonstrating significant improvements in serving throughput and latency [4]. However, the optimal cache size and eviction policy can vary depending on the specific workload and system design [5].

Our work contributes to this body of research by providing a comprehensive characterization of KV$ workload patterns and proposing a workload-aware cache eviction policy that improves serving performance under real-world traces.

The importance of efficient caching mechanisms for large language models (LLMs) has been increasingly recognized, given their substantial memory and computational demands [1]. Caching intermediate results, specifically key-value (KV) pairs, is crucial for improving the serving throughput and latency of LLMs [2]. Various studies have explored the benefits of KV caching, focusing on aspects such as cache eviction policies, which are highly dependent on workload patterns.

Several recent works have proposed different eviction policies to manage the KV cache effectively. These policies often aim to optimize cache utilization under a given budget, considering factors such as importance scores and eviction scope [1]. For instance, some approaches have utilized temporal attention scores and robustness measures to enhance cache efficiency [1]. The efficacy of these policies has been evaluated across different stages, including prefilling and auto-regressive decoding.

Characterizing KV workload patterns has also been an area of interest, with studies analyzing the reuse of KV pairs across requests [3]. Observations from real-world traces have highlighted the skewness of KV reuses and the predictability of patterns for specific request categories [3]. These findings underscore the need for workload-aware cache eviction policies that can adapt to diverse workload characteristics.

Existing literature also discusses the challenges associated with deploying LLMs in resource-constrained environments and the role of KV caching in mitigating these challenges [1][2]. The development of software packages dedicated to user-friendly key-value constrained generative inference, such as EasyKV, further emphasizes the practical implications of this research [1].

The increasing demand for serving large language models (LLMs) has led to a focus on optimizing their performance and efficiency. One crucial aspect of this is caching intermediate results, specifically KV (key-value) caches, to improve serving throughput and latency [1]. Our work builds upon and diverges from existing research in several areas.

KV caching has been recognized as a vital component in LLM serving. Previous studies have explored the benefits of KV caching [2], but these often rely on synthetic workloads, which may not accurately reflect real-world patterns. In contrast, our characterization of KV workload patterns from a leading LLM service provider reveals nuanced insights, such as the skewed reuse of KV across requests and the predictability of reuse patterns for specific request categories.

Effective cache management is critical for maximizing the benefits of KV caching. Cache eviction policies play a significant role in determining cache performance. Traditional policies, such as LRU (Least Recently Used) and FIFO (First-In-First-Out), may not be optimal for KV workloads [3]. Recent studies have proposed more sophisticated policies, including those leveraging machine learning [4] and those tailored to specific workload characteristics [5]. Our proposed workload-aware cache eviction policy contributes to this line of research by incorporating insights from real-world KV workload patterns.

Quantization techniques have also been explored to address the challenges of large model sizes and memory constraints in LLMs [6]. While our work does not directly focus on quantization, it is relevant to the broader context of optimizing LLM serving. Efficient inference and memory management are crucial for scalable LLM deployment, and techniques like quantization can complement caching strategies.

The characterization of KV workload patterns and the development of optimized cache eviction policies are essential for improving LLM serving performance. Our work aims to bridge the gap between existing research and real-world LLM serving needs, providing a more comprehensive understanding of KV caching and its implications for system design.

Caching intermediate results, specifically key-value (KV) pairs, has been identified as a crucial technique [1]. However, the benefits of KV caching in LLM serving and the design of effective cache management policies remain underexplored, particularly in real-world scenarios.

Previous studies have primarily focused on synthetic workloads, leaving a gap in understanding the KV workload patterns in practical LLM serving environments [2]. Our work aims to fill this gap by presenting a systematic characterization of KV workload patterns from a leading LLM service provider. This characterization reveals several key insights: KV reuses are skewed across requests, with reuses between single-turn requests being equally important as those between multi-turn requests; the reuse time and probability vary significantly across all requests but tend to be predictable within specific request categories; and the overall cache size required for an ideal cache hit ratio is moderate.

These findings have implications for the design of cache eviction policies. A straightforward approach to reducing KV cache size is quantization, which has been explored in the context of reducing memory demands [3]. However, there is limited understanding of how quantization affects real-world LLM serving performance. Recent works have proposed various strategies to optimize cache management, including understanding the element distribution of KV cache to inform quantization strategies [3] and proposing tuning-free KV cache quantization algorithms [3].

The importance of caching in improving the performance of large language models (LLMs) has been widely recognized [1]. Caching intermediate results, often referred to as KV$ caching, can significantly enhance serving throughput and latency [2]. A critical component of KV$ caching is the cache eviction policy, which determines how to manage cache space efficiently. Various policies have been proposed and studied, including MRU (Most Recently Used), MFU (Most Frequently Used), LRU (Least Recently Used), and LFU (Least Frequently Used) [3].

LRU is one of the most widely used cache eviction algorithms due to its simplicity and $O(1)$ time complexity [3]. However, its performance can be limited in scenarios where the access pattern does not follow a straightforward recency-based eviction strategy. On the other hand, LFU considers the frequency of access, which can be beneficial for workloads with skewed access patterns [4]. Despite its advantages, LFU's higher time complexity has limited its adoption in some applications.

Recent studies have focused on understanding the characteristics of KV$ workloads and optimizing cache eviction policies for LLMs. For instance, characterizing KV$ workload patterns is crucial for designing efficient cache eviction policies [5]. Some studies have analyzed synthetic workloads, but there is a need for more research based on real-world traces [1].

Our work builds upon these studies by presenting a systematic characterization of KV$ workload patterns from a leading LLM service provider. We observe that KV$ reuses are skewed across requests, and the reuse time and probability are diverse but predictable for specific request categories [1]. Based on these observations, we propose a workload-aware cache eviction policy that improves serving performance under real-world traces, especially with limited cache capacity.

The increasing demand for serving large language models (LLMs) has led to a focus on optimizing their deployment, particularly through caching intermediate results, such as key-value (KV) pairs, to enhance serving throughput and latency [1]. Our work builds upon the understanding that KV caching is crucial for improving the efficiency of LLM serving.

Several studies have explored the benefits of KV caching for LLMs. For instance, the impact of cache eviction policies on serving performance has been examined, highlighting the need for workload-aware strategies [2]. However, these studies often rely on synthetic workloads, which may not accurately reflect real-world patterns.

Recent research has proposed various methods to optimize KV caching. Some approaches focus on compressing the KV cache to reduce memory overhead, such as eviction and merging [3]. Others have introduced novel caching schemes, like uncertainty-aware compression, which adaptively compresses both hidden states and the KV cache [4].

Characterizing KV workload patterns is essential for designing effective caching strategies. While previous studies have investigated these patterns, they often overlook the diversity of reuse times and probabilities across different request categories [5]. Our work aims to address this gap by presenting a systematic characterization of KV workload patterns from a leading LLM service provider.

Our proposed workload-aware cache eviction policy is informed by these characterization efforts. By considering the predictable patterns of KV reuses for specific request categories, our policy can improve serving performance under real-world traces, especially with limited cache capacity.

The importance of efficiently serving large language models (LLMs) has been increasingly recognized, with a focus on optimizing caching strategies to improve serving throughput and latency. Caching intermediate results, specifically key-value (KV) pairs, has been identified as a crucial technique [1]. Our work builds upon the understanding that KV caching benefits LLM serving, but there is a need for a systematic characterization of real-world KV workload patterns.

Previous studies have primarily focused on synthetic workloads [2][3], which may not accurately reflect the complexities of real-world scenarios. In contrast, our characterization is based on KV workload patterns from a leading LLM service provider, offering new insights into KV reuse patterns. Specifically, we observe that KV reuses are skewed across requests, with reuses between single-turn requests being equally important as multi-turn requests. This finding contrasts with previous assumptions and highlights the need for workload-aware caching strategies.

Several caching strategies have been proposed to improve cache efficiency, including cache eviction policies [4][5]. However, these policies often rely on simplified workload models and may not perform optimally in real-world scenarios. Our proposed workload-aware cache eviction policy aims to address this limitation by taking into account the diverse KV reuse patterns observed in our characterization.

Recent works have also explored the use of advanced caching techniques, such as KV cache compression [6]. This approach aims to reduce the memory footprint of the KV cache, enabling more efficient serving of LLMs. While compression techniques are promising, our work focuses on optimizing cache eviction policies, which can be complementary to compression techniques.

The growing demand for serving large language models (LLMs) efficiently has led to significant research into optimizing their inference processes. One key area of focus has been the use of KV cache to store pre-computed keys and values, which can substantially improve serving throughput and latency [1]. However, the effectiveness of KV cache is highly dependent on system design decisions, such as cache eviction policies, which can be workload-dependent.

Previous studies have explored various methods to compress the KV cache, including pruning pre-computed KV cache to reduce memory usage [2]. However, these methods often neglect the inter-layer dependency between layers and the huge memory consumption in pre-computation. Recent work, such as PyramidInfer, has proposed layer-wise retaining crucial context to compress the KV cache, achieving significant memory savings and improved throughput [1].

Characterizing KV workload patterns has also been an area of research. While previous studies have focused on synthetic workloads, there is limited understanding of real-world KV workload patterns. Our work aims to fill this gap by presenting a systematic characterization of KV workload patterns from a leading LLM service provider.

Our findings on KV reuse patterns, including the skewness of reuses across requests and the predictability of reuse patterns for specific request categories, have implications for cache eviction policy design. Previous work has proposed various cache eviction policies, but these are often based on synthetic workloads or simplistic assumptions [3]. In contrast, our workload-aware cache eviction policy is designed based on real-world traces and achieves improved serving performance, especially with limited cache capacity.

The importance of efficient LLM serving has also led to research into other optimization techniques, such as model pruning and knowledge distillation [4][5]. However, these techniques often require significant modifications to the model architecture or training process, whereas KV cache optimization can be applied more straightforwardly to existing LLM serving systems.

extensive results with LLaVA-OV-7B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B on six benchmarks show
that VidKV effectively compresses the KV cache to 1.5-bit and 1.58-bit

The importance of caching intermediate results (KV cache) in serving large language models (LLMs) has been recognized, with significant implications for throughput and latency [1]. Previous studies have explored various aspects of KV cache, including its impact on system performance [2]. However, there is limited understanding of how LLM serving benefits from KV cache, particularly in real-world scenarios.

Characterization of KV workload patterns has been an area of interest, with some studies focusing on synthetic workloads [3]. In contrast, our work presents a systematic characterization of KV workload patterns from a leading LLM service provider, revealing new insights. For instance, we find that KV reuses are skewed across requests, with reuses between single-turn requests being equally important as multi-turn requests. This observation is consistent with [4], which highlights the importance of considering real-world workload patterns.

Cache eviction policies have also been explored, with some studies proposing workload-agnostic approaches [5]. However, our work demonstrates the benefits of a workload-aware cache eviction policy, which improves serving performance under real-world traces, especially with limited cache capacity. This finding is in line with [6], which emphasizes the need for workload-aware optimization in LLM serving.

Quantization of KV cache has been proposed as a means to reduce memory requirements and improve inference speed [7]. However, the limit of KV cache quantization in lower bits has not been fully investigated. Recent works, such as VidKV [8], have introduced plug-and-play KV cache quantization methods to compress the KV cache to lower than 2 bits.

Our work complements these efforts by focusing on the characterization of KV workload patterns and the design of workload-aware cache eviction policies. By understanding the real-world workload patterns and optimizing cache eviction policies accordingly, we can improve the serving performance of LLMs.

The growing importance of serving large language models (LLMs) in cloud environments has sparked significant interest in optimizing their performance. One crucial optimization is the use of caching intermediate results, specifically the key-value (KV) cache, which has been shown to substantially improve serving throughput and latency [1]. However, there is limited understanding of how LLM serving benefits from KV caching, particularly in real-world scenarios.

Previous studies have primarily focused on synthetic workloads, which may not accurately reflect real-world usage patterns [2]. In contrast, our work presents a systematic characterization of KV workload patterns from a leading LLM service provider, revealing new insights into the reuse patterns of KV caches. Specifically, we find that KV reuses are skewed across requests, with reuses between single-turn requests being equally important as multi-turn requests [1]. This observation is consistent with the findings of [3], which highlights the importance of considering real-world workload patterns in the design of caching systems.

The characterization of KV workload patterns has also led to the development of workload-aware cache eviction policies. For example, [4] proposes a policy that takes into account the predictability of reuse patterns for specific request categories. Our work builds on this idea, proposing a workload-aware cache eviction policy that improves serving performance under real-world traces, especially with limited cache capacity.

The use of KV caching in LLMs has also been explored in the context of specific applications, such as prefill-only workloads [5]. Prefill-only workloads, which involve generating only a single output token, offer opportunities for optimization by reducing the GPU memory footprint and enabling efficient scheduling policies [5]. Our work complements these efforts by providing a systematic understanding of KV workload patterns and their implications for caching system design.

The efficient serving of large language models (LLMs) has garnered significant attention in recent years due to the growing demand for cloud-based AI services. One crucial aspect of LLM serving is caching intermediate results, often referred to as KV$ caching, which can substantially improve serving throughput and latency [1]. However, the benefits of KV$ caching are highly dependent on system design decisions, such as cache eviction policies, which are workload-dependent.

Several studies have explored the importance of caching in LLM serving. For instance, [2] highlights the significance of KV$ caching in improving serving performance. However, these studies often rely on synthetic workloads, which may not accurately reflect real-world scenarios. In contrast, our work presents a systematic characterization of KV$ workload patterns from a leading LLM service provider, revealing insights that were not covered by previous studies.

One key observation from our characterization is that KV$ reuses are skewed across requests, with reuses between single-turn requests being equally important as multi-turn requests [1]. This finding has implications for cache eviction policies, which should prioritize requests based on their reuse patterns. Another study, [3], proposes a dynamic cache allocation approach for LLMs, which can be complementary to our workload-aware cache eviction policy.

The proposed workload-aware cache eviction policy in our paper aims to improve serving performance under real-world traces, particularly with limited cache capacity. This is in line with the efforts of [4], which explores the design of efficient caching systems for LLMs. Furthermore, [5] emphasizes the need for adaptive caching strategies in dynamic environments, which aligns with our proposed policy.

In conclusion, our work contributes to the growing body of research on efficient LLM serving, caching, and workload-aware optimization. By characterizing KV$ workload patterns and proposing a workload-aware cache eviction policy, we aim to improve the serving performance of LLMs in real-world scenarios.

The growing demand for serving large language models (LLMs) efficiently has led to significant research in optimizing their performance, particularly through caching intermediate results, such as key-value (KV) pairs. Caching these results can substantially improve serving throughput and latency [1]. However, the benefits of KV caching are highly dependent on system design decisions, including cache eviction policies, which are workload-dependent.

Several studies have explored caching strategies for LLMs. For instance, prefix caching has been proposed to reduce redundant computations by reusing KV pairs for repeated prefixes in user queries [2]. However, this approach faces challenges when chunks appear at arbitrary locations with arbitrary contexts, leading to output quality degradation. Recent works, such as Cache-Craft, have addressed these challenges by managing and reusing precomputed KV pairs corresponding to text chunks in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based systems [3]. Cache-Craft reduces redundant computation by 51% over state-of-the-art prefix-caching and 75% over full recomputation.

Characterizing KV workload patterns is crucial for designing efficient caching systems. Previous studies have focused on synthetic workloads [4][5], but these may not accurately reflect real-world scenarios. Our work presents the first systematic characterization of KV workload patterns from a leading LLM service provider, revealing that KV reuses are skewed across requests, with reuses between single-turn requests being equally important as multi-turn requests.

Based on this characterization, we propose a workload-aware cache eviction policy that improves serving performance under real-world traces, especially with limited cache capacity. This policy builds on the observations that the reuse time and probability are diverse considering all requests, but for a specific request category, the pattern tends to be predictable [6].

This has led to the exploration of various design spaces, including collocating stored KV caches with GPUs and KV cache compression. However, the economic feasibility of such approaches, particularly in terms of cloud costs, has been less studied.

Characterizing KV$ workload patterns is crucial for optimizing cache performance. Previous studies have focused on synthetic workloads [3], but real-world patterns may exhibit different characteristics. Our analysis of KV$ reuses reveals that they are skewed across requests, with reuses between single-turn requests being equally important as multi-turn requests [1]. This finding aligns with the observation that the reuse time and probability are diverse when considering all requests, but tend to be predictable for specific request categories.

Cache eviction policies have been widely studied in the context of caching [4][5]. However, these policies often rely on idealized assumptions about workload patterns. Recent work has proposed analytical models for cloud costs associated with storing and reusing KV caches [2]. These models consider various workload parameters, such as reuse frequency and generated text lengths.

Our work complements these efforts by providing a systematic characterization of real-world KV$ workload patterns and proposing a workload-aware cache eviction policy. This policy aims to improve serving performance under real-world traces, especially with limited cache capacity.

2502.02750v1,Cache is King: Smart Page Eviction with eBPF,http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02750v1,"The page cache is a central part of an OS. It reduces repeated accesses to
storage by deciding which pages to retain in memory. As a result, the page
cache has a significant impact on the performance of many applications.
However, its one-size-fits-all eviction policy performs poorly in many
workloads. While the systems community has experimented with a plethora of new
and adaptive eviction policies in non-OS settings (e.g., key-value stores,
CDNs), it is very difficult to implement such policies in the page cache, due
to the complexity of modifying kernel code. To address these shortcomings, we
design a novel eBPF-based framework for the Linux page cache, called

to the complexity of modifying kernel code. To address these shortcomings, we
design a novel eBPF-based framework for the Linux page cache, called
$\texttt{cachebpf}$, that allows developers to customize the page cache without

The importance of caching in improving the performance of large language models (LLMs) has been recognized in recent studies. Caching intermediate results, particularly key-value (KV) pairs, can significantly enhance serving throughput and latency [1]. A crucial aspect of KV caching is the design of effective cache eviction policies, which are highly dependent on workload patterns.

Several studies have explored the benefits of caching in various contexts, including web caching [2] and content delivery networks (CDNs) [3]. However, these studies often focus on synthetic workloads or specific use cases, which may not accurately reflect real-world scenarios. In contrast, our work presents a systematic characterization of KV workload patterns from a leading LLM service provider, revealing new insights into the reuse patterns and cache requirements of LLMs.

The characterization of KV workload patterns has been explored in previous studies, but often with limited scope. For example, some studies have analyzed the reuse patterns of KV pairs in specific contexts, such as multi-turn requests [4]. However, these studies have not considered the broader implications of KV caching for LLM serving, including the importance of workload-aware cache eviction policies.

Recent work has proposed novel cache eviction policies for various applications, including eBPF-based frameworks for the Linux page cache [5]. These policies aim to optimize cache performance by adapting to specific workload patterns. Similarly, our work proposes a workload-aware cache eviction policy that improves serving performance under real-world traces, particularly with limited cache capacity.

The benefits of customizable cache policies have also been explored in other contexts, such as key-value stores and CDNs [6]. These studies demonstrate the potential for adaptive cache policies to improve performance in various applications. Our work builds on these insights, proposing a workload-aware cache eviction policy that is tailored to the specific needs of LLM serving.
