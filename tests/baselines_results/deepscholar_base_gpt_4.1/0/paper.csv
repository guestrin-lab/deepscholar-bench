The challenge of economic inequality and the quest for adaptive tax policies have been extensively explored in various studies. Traditional tax systems, such as the U.S. federal income tax, aim to reduce inequality but often lack the adaptability required to address dynamic socio-economic changes [1]. 

Optimal taxation models, like the Saez Optimal Taxation, have been proposed to adjust tax rates dynamically based on economic conditions and taxpayer behavior [2]. However, these models have limitations, particularly in addressing taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior, which are crucial for effective tax policy design.

Recent advancements in computational economics and artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled the development of more sophisticated models that can simulate complex socio-economic interactions. For instance, agent-based modeling (ABM) has been used to study the emergence of informal economic activities and tax evasion behaviors [3]. These models have highlighted the importance of considering individual personality traits, external narratives, enforcement probabilities, and the perceived efficiency of public goods provision in shaping compliance behavior.

The integration of large language models (LLMs) with ABM has shown promise in designing adaptive policies that can respond to heterogeneous agent behaviors [4]. This approach allows for more nuanced simulations of real-world taxpayer behaviors and can provide insights into the equity-efficiency trade-offs of different tax policies.

Studies have also emphasized the need for robust enforcement mechanisms and efficient public goods provision to curtail informal economic activities effectively [3]. The interplay between tax policy design, taxpayer behavior, and socio-economic outcomes underscores the complexity of achieving optimal taxation.

In the context of adaptive tax policy design, [5] proposed a framework that leverages LLMs and ABM to optimize tax rates based on dynamic socio-economic conditions. Their findings demonstrated the potential of this approach to achieve superior equity-efficiency trade-offs compared to traditional tax systems.

Benchmarking against existing taxation models, such as the Saez Optimal Taxation and U.S. federal income taxes, is crucial for evaluating the performance of novel frameworks like TaxAgent [2]. The pursuit of superior equity-efficiency trade-offs in taxation policies remains a central goal, and innovative approaches that leverage LLMs and ABM can contribute significantly to this endeavor [1].

More advanced models, like the Saez Optimal Taxation, propose dynamic adjustments but may not fully account for taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior [2].

Recent research has turned to agent-based modeling (ABM) and machine learning techniques to simulate economic systems and design more effective policies. For instance, multi-agent simulators have been increasingly used in economic modeling to capture the complex interactions among different types of agents, such as households, firms, and the government [3]. These models often incorporate reinforcement learning (RL) to enable agents to adapt and make decisions based on their environment.

However, existing studies typically focus on specific agent categories and overlook the interactions and adaptations of other pivotal agents in the economic system [3]. Furthermore, the distribution of tax credits and its impact on household behavior and social welfare has gained attention [3]. Some research proposes innovative government policies to distribute tax credits strategically, aiming to reduce disparities among households and improve social welfare [3].

The integration of large language models (LLMs) with ABM has also been explored to enhance the design of adaptive policies. For example, LLMs can be utilized to optimize tax rates by iteratively learning from the behavior of heterogeneous agents [4]. This approach enables more nuanced and responsive policy-making, potentially leading to better equity-efficiency trade-offs.

Several studies have benchmarked their proposed models against existing tax systems and policies, such as the Saez Optimal Taxation and U.S. federal income taxes [2][5]. These comparisons highlight the potential benefits of more adaptive and data-driven approaches to fiscal policy evaluation.

The concept of fair re-ranking and taxation has garnered significant attention in recent years, particularly in the context of recommendation systems and economic policy optimization. Our work draws inspiration from the taxation perspective on fair re-ranking [1], which formulates fair re-ranking as a taxation process. This perspective provides valuable insights into the redistribution of ranking slots among items to ensure responsibility and ethics.

Several studies have explored the application of taxation principles in recommendation systems. For instance, [1] demonstrates that most previous fair re-ranking methods can be reformulated as an item-level tax policy. However, these methods face challenges in meeting two ideal controllable requirements: continuity and controllability over accuracy loss.

To address these challenges, novel approaches have been proposed. For example, the Tax-rank method [1] levies taxes based on the difference in utility between two items and utilizes the Sinkhorn algorithm in optimal transport to optimize the objective. This approach offers a superior tax policy for fair re-ranking, theoretically demonstrating both continuity and controllability over accuracy loss.

In the context of economic policy optimization, researchers have proposed various models to address taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior. The Saez Optimal Taxation model [2] adjusts dynamically but fails to account for taxpayer heterogeneity. In contrast, our proposed TaxAgent model integrates large language models (LLMs) with agent-based modeling (ABM) to design adaptive tax policies that balance equity and productivity.

Our work also draws inspiration from the use of LLMs in macroeconomic simulations. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of LLMs in simulating real-world economic scenarios [3]. Our TaxAgent model builds upon this research, utilizing LLMs to iteratively optimize tax rates in a macroeconomic simulation with heterogeneous H-Agents.

The intersection of fiscal policy, economic inequality, and innovative modeling techniques has garnered significant attention in recent years. Our work, which introduces TaxAgent, a novel integration of large language models (LLMs) with agent-based modeling (ABM) for designing adaptive tax policies, builds upon and contributes to several key areas of research.

First, the study of fiscal policy's impact on economic inequality is a well-established field. Traditional tax systems, such as the U.S. federal income tax, aim to reduce inequality but often lack adaptability [1]. More dynamic models, like the Saez Optimal Taxation, adjust tax rates to optimize equity and efficiency but may not fully account for taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior [2].

Recent research has explored the use of agent-based modeling to simulate the effects of fiscal policies on heterogeneous agents. These models allow for a more nuanced understanding of how different policy interventions can affect various segments of the population [3]. Our work extends this line of research by incorporating LLMs to iteratively optimize tax rates, providing a more adaptive and responsive fiscal policy framework.

The concept of liquidity traps and the role of fiscal policy in escaping them, as discussed in [4], also informs our understanding of the macroeconomic context in which TaxAgent operates. The idea that activist but sustainable fiscal policy regimes can help economies escape liquidity traps and achieve globally stable inflation paths [4] underscores the importance of dynamic and responsive fiscal policy tools, such as those provided by TaxAgent.

Furthermore, the integration of LLMs with ABM represents a cutting-edge methodological innovation. LLMs have shown promise in optimizing complex systems and making predictions based on large datasets [5]. By leveraging these capabilities within an ABM framework, TaxAgent offers a scalable and data-driven approach to fiscal policy evaluation.

Our work also relates to research on the equity-efficiency trade-off in taxation. Traditional tax policies often face challenges in balancing these competing objectives [6]. The TaxAgent framework, by iteratively optimizing tax rates based on real-time data and simulations, aims to achieve superior equity-efficiency trade-offs compared to existing models and policies.

The problem of optimal taxation and its impact on economic inequality has been a longstanding concern in economic research. Traditional taxation systems, such as the U.S. federal income tax, aim to reduce inequality but often lack adaptability to changing economic conditions [1]. Dynamic models like the Saez Optimal Taxation model have been proposed to address this issue, but they have limitations, such as not accounting for taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior [2].

Recent studies have explored the use of agent-based modeling (ABM) to simulate the behavior of heterogeneous agents and evaluate the impact of taxation policies. For instance, ABM has been used to study the effects of taxation on economic growth and inequality [3]. However, these models often rely on simplistic assumptions about taxpayer behavior and do not account for the complexity of real-world decision-making.

The integration of large language models (LLMs) with ABM has the potential to revolutionize the field of taxation policy evaluation. LLMs can capture complex patterns in taxpayer behavior and provide a more nuanced understanding of the impact of taxation policies on different segments of the population [4]. Our work builds on this idea and introduces a novel integration of LLMs with ABM to design adaptive tax policies that balance equity and productivity.

Our approach is distinct from existing work in that it uses LLMs to iteratively optimize tax rates based on the behavior of heterogeneous agents. This approach allows for a more dynamic and adaptive taxation system that can respond to changing economic conditions [5]. We benchmark our approach against existing taxation systems, including the Saez Optimal Taxation model, U.S. federal income taxes, and free markets, and demonstrate that it achieves superior equity-efficiency trade-offs.

The issue of economic inequality and its mitigation through taxation policies has been extensively studied. Traditional taxation systems, such as the U.S. federal income tax, aim to reduce inequality but often lack the adaptability required to address dynamic economic changes [1]. Various models, including the Saez Optimal Taxation, have been proposed to adjust tax policies dynamically. However, these models have limitations, such as not fully accounting for taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior [2].

Agent-based modeling (ABM) has emerged as a valuable tool for studying economic systems and policy impacts. For instance, Castro de Oliveira [3] proposed an agent-based model to investigate the effects of non-uniform income redistribution policies and tax evasion on wealth distribution. This model demonstrated the importance of well-designed policies in promoting more egalitarian societies.

Building on this work, our study introduces a novel approach by integrating large language models (LLMs) with ABM to design adaptive tax policies. This integration allows for more sophisticated and responsive modeling of taxpayer behavior and government policy optimization. Unlike traditional models, our TaxAgent framework utilizes LLMs to iteratively optimize tax rates, balancing equity and productivity [4].

Several studies have highlighted the potential of ABM in analyzing tax policies and their effects on economic inequality. For example, simulations of optimal taxation models have shown that dynamic adjustments can lead to better equity-efficiency trade-offs [5]. However, these models often rely on simplifying assumptions about taxpayer behavior.

In contrast, our TaxAgent framework incorporates heterogeneous household agents (H-Agents) that simulate real-world taxpayer behaviors, providing a more nuanced and realistic analysis. By benchmarking our approach against existing models, such as Saez Optimal Taxation, U.S. federal income taxes, and free markets, we demonstrate the superior equity-efficiency trade-offs achievable with TaxAgent.

The use of LLMs in policy optimization offers a scalable and data-driven approach to fiscal policy evaluation. This integration enables policymakers to explore a wide range of scenarios and outcomes, facilitating more informed decision-making [6].

The relationship between economic inequality, mobility, and the financial accumulation process has been a subject of interest in computational economics. Studies have shown that the financial accumulation process featuring compound returns plays a significant role as a source of inequality [1]. Institutional arrangements, including taxation, also play a crucial role in framing and shaping the aggregate economic process that evolves over socioeconomic space and time [1].

Traditional taxation systems, such as the U.S. federal income tax, aim to reduce inequality but often lack adaptability [2]. Dynamic models like the Saez Optimal Taxation have been proposed to address this issue, but they fail to account for taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior [2]. 

Agent-based modeling (ABM) has been used to study the impact of taxation on economic inequality [3]. ABM allows for the simulation of heterogeneous agents and their interactions, providing insights into the effects of taxation on macroeconomic outcomes. 

The use of large language models (LLMs) in economic modeling is a relatively new area of research [4]. LLMs have shown promise in analyzing complex economic systems and optimizing policy interventions [5].

Our work builds on these studies by introducing TaxAgent, a novel integration of LLMs with ABM to design adaptive tax policies.

The challenge of designing optimal tax policies that balance equity and productivity has been a longstanding concern in economic research. Traditional tax systems, such as the U.S. federal income tax, aim to reduce inequality but often lack adaptability to changing economic conditions [1]. In response, various models have been proposed to optimize tax policies, including the Saez Optimal Taxation model, which adjusts dynamically but may not fully account for taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior [2].

Recent studies have explored the use of advanced computational methods to improve tax policy design. For instance, agent-based modeling (ABM) has been employed to simulate the behavior of heterogeneous taxpayers and evaluate the impact of different tax policies [3]. The integration of large language models (LLMs) with ABM has also shown promise in optimizing tax rates and improving equity-efficiency trade-offs [4].

The concept of optimal income taxation has been extensively studied in the literature, with a focus on characterizing the properties of optimal tax schedules [5]. The fairness principle, which suggests that the optimal tax at any income level should be invariant under a family of properly adjusted Gaussian averages of the optimal taxes at other income levels, has been proposed as a key property of optimal tax policies [6]. This principle has been shown to arise from the efficient smoothing of the tax burden and generated revenues across incomes.

Dynamical methods have also been applied to the study of optimal income taxation, with a focus on gradient flows of taxes that change the existing tax system in the direction of increasing tax revenues [7]. These gradient flows have been shown to take the form of a heat equation, which provides a unified weighting scheme for tax policies across different income ranges.

In contrast to traditional models, our study introduces TaxAgent, a novel integration of LLMs with ABM to design adaptive tax policies that account for taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior. Our approach builds on the strengths of existing models, such as the Saez Optimal Taxation model, while incorporating the flexibility and adaptability of LLMs and ABM.

One of the key limitations of traditional optimal taxation models, such as the Mirrlees' theory, is their tendency to not lead to progressive taxation and sometimes assign minimal tax rates to higher-paid strata of society [3].

In the context of taxation, this approach can help capture the complexities of taxpayer behavior and heterogeneity. For example, agent-based models have been used to simulate the impact of tax policies on economic outcomes [6].

By simulating real-world taxpayer behaviors and iteratively optimizing tax rates, TaxAgent achieves superior equity-efficiency trade-offs compared to traditional models [8].

The use of LLMs in TaxAgent offers a promising approach to improving the adaptability and effectiveness of tax policies. For instance, LLMs can be used to analyze large datasets and identify patterns in taxpayer behavior that can inform optimal tax policies [9].

The intersection of economic policy, public health, and technological innovation presents a multifaceted challenge in addressing global issues such as economic inequality and epidemic management. Our work, which introduces TaxAgent, a novel integration of large language models (LLMs) with agent-based modeling (ABM) for designing adaptive tax policies, builds upon a foundation of research in optimal taxation, economic epidemiology, and the application of artificial intelligence in policy-making.

Optimal taxation models, such as the Saez Optimal Taxation [1], have been pivotal in shaping tax policies to reduce inequality and optimize economic outcomes. However, these models often lack the dynamism required to address complex, real-world scenarios, including taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior. Our approach, leveraging LLMs and ABM, aims to overcome these limitations by simulating real-world taxpayer behaviors and iteratively optimizing tax rates to balance equity and productivity.

In the realm of economic epidemiology, studies have explored the impact of diseases on economic outcomes and the role of policy interventions in mitigating these effects. For instance, research on the optimal control of disease prevention and treatment [2] highlights the importance of considering both infection and economic costs in policy decisions. This line of work underscores the need for integrated approaches that consider both health and economic outcomes, a perspective that informs our development of TaxAgent.

The application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning in policy-making is a rapidly evolving field. Recent works have demonstrated the potential of AI-driven approaches to optimize policy interventions in various domains [3][4]. Our integration of LLMs with ABM to design adaptive tax policies contributes to this growing body of research, offering a scalable and data-driven framework for fiscal policy evaluation.

Furthermore, the use of agent-based modeling to simulate complex economic systems and policy interventions has been well-established [5]. By incorporating heterogeneous agents that simulate real-world behaviors, our work builds on this methodological foundation to provide more nuanced and realistic assessments of tax policy impacts.

In conclusion, our research on TaxAgent represents a novel approach to addressing economic inequality through adaptive tax policies, informed by advancements in optimal taxation, economic epidemiology, and AI-driven policy-making. By offering a more dynamic and responsive framework for tax policy design, we aim to contribute to the ongoing discourse on how to effectively tackle global challenges such as economic inequality and public health crises.

Economic inequality has been a persistent challenge globally, affecting various aspects of society, including education, healthcare, and social stability. Traditional taxation systems, such as the U.S. federal income tax, aim to mitigate inequality but often lack the adaptability required to address dynamic economic conditions [1]. 

Various models have been proposed to optimize taxation and reduce inequality. The Saez Optimal Taxation model is one such example that adjusts tax rates dynamically based on economic conditions [2]. However, these models have limitations, particularly in addressing taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior, which are crucial factors in real-world economies.

Agent-based modeling (ABM) has emerged as a powerful tool for simulating complex economic systems, allowing for the analysis of interactions among heterogeneous agents [3]. The integration of large language models (LLMs) with ABM has further enhanced the capability of these models to capture complex behaviors and optimize policies.

In the context of fiscal policy evaluation and taxation, several studies have explored the use of ABM to simulate economic systems and evaluate policy interventions [4]. These models often focus on the interactions between heterogeneous agents, such as households and firms, and the impact of policy changes on economic outcomes.

The use of LLMs in policy optimization is a relatively recent development, with applications in various fields, including economics [5]. The ability of LLMs to process and analyze large datasets makes them suitable for optimizing complex policies, such as taxation.

Our study builds on this body of research, introducing a novel integration of LLMs with ABM to design adaptive tax policies. The TaxAgent framework offers a scalable and data-driven approach to fiscal policy evaluation, addressing the limitations of traditional models and providing a more nuanced understanding of taxpayer behavior.

The study of economic inequality and its mitigation through fiscal policies has been a longstanding area of research in economics. Traditional tax systems, such as the U.S. federal income tax, aim to reduce inequality but often lack adaptability to changing economic conditions [1]. Dynamic models like the Saez Optimal Taxation framework have been proposed to address these limitations, but they typically fail to account for taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior [2].

Recent research has explored the use of agent-based modeling (ABM) to study the impact of fiscal policies on economic inequality. For instance, [3] investigate the dynamics of wealth inequality in an economy with positional preferences, demonstrating that the economy converges to a unique egalitarian steady-state equilibrium under certain conditions. This line of research highlights the importance of considering the behavioral aspects of taxpayers in the design of tax policies.

The integration of large language models (LLMs) with ABM has also been explored in recent studies. For example, [4] propose a framework for using LLMs to analyze and optimize economic systems. However, the application of LLMs to the design of adaptive tax policies, as proposed in our study, is a novel contribution.

Our work builds on the existing literature on optimal taxation, ABM, and LLMs. Specifically, we draw on the insights from [3] on the importance of considering positional preferences in the study of wealth inequality. We also leverage the dynamic optimization approach of [2] and the behavioral modeling framework of [5].

Our study offers a novel solution to the challenge of designing adaptive tax policies that balance equity and productivity. The use of LLMs to optimize tax rates in a heterogeneous agent-based model allows for a more nuanced understanding of taxpayer behavior and its impact on economic outcomes. Our results demonstrate the potential of this approach to achieve superior equity-efficiency trade-offs compared to traditional tax systems.

The intersection of economic inequality, taxation, and behavioral modeling has garnered significant attention in recent literature. Traditional taxation systems, such as the U.S. federal income tax, aim to reduce inequality but often lack adaptability [1]. Dynamic models like the Saez Optimal Taxation framework adjust tax rates based on income levels but fail to account for taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior [2].

Recent studies have explored integrating machine learning and agent-based modeling to design more adaptive and equitable tax policies. For instance, some research has focused on using machine learning algorithms to optimize tax rates and minimize inequality [3]. However, these models often rely on simplistic assumptions about taxpayer behavior.

In contrast, our study introduces TaxAgent, a novel integration of large language models (LLMs) with agent-based modeling (ABM) to design adaptive tax policies. This approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of taxpayer behavior and heterogeneity. Similar to [4], we use heterogeneous agents (H-Agents) to simulate real-world taxpayer behaviors, but our model also incorporates LLMs to iteratively optimize tax rates.

Our work builds upon existing research in macroeconomic simulation and fiscal policy evaluation [5]. Specifically, we benchmark our TaxAgent model against traditional taxation systems, such as the Saez Optimal Taxation framework and U.S. federal income taxes, and demonstrate superior equity-efficiency trade-offs.

The use of LLMs in economic modeling is a rapidly growing area of research [6]. Our study contributes to this literature by demonstrating the potential of LLMs to improve the design of adaptive tax policies. Furthermore, our results are consistent with [7], which highlights the importance of considering taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior in tax policy design.

ABM has been used to simulate the behavior of heterogeneous agents in various economic contexts, providing insights into the interactions between agents and the emergence of macroeconomic phenomena [4]. LLMs, with their ability to process and analyze vast amounts of data, can be leveraged to optimize tax policies in real-time, taking into account the complex behaviors of taxpayers [5].

The use of LLMs in fiscal policy design is a relatively new area of research, with some studies exploring their potential in predicting economic outcomes and optimizing policy interventions [6]. However, the integration of LLMs with ABM, as proposed in this study, offers a novel approach to designing adaptive tax policies that account for taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior.

Other studies have also explored the implications of defaultable debt and distortionary taxes on fiscal policy [7]. These studies highlight the importance of considering the interactions between the government's fiscal policy and the behavior of households in understanding the dynamics of economic inequality.

The current study builds on this literature by introducing TaxAgent, a novel integration of LLMs with ABM, to design adaptive tax policies that balance equity and productivity. By benchmarking TaxAgent against existing models, such as Saez Optimal Taxation, and evaluating its performance in a macroeconomic simulation, this study offers a new solution for taxation and a scalable framework for fiscal policy evaluation.

The study of economic inequality and its mitigation through taxation policies has a rich history in economic literature. The Ramsey model [1], introduced in 1928, is a cornerstone of economic growth theory and has been widely used to study the effects of taxation on economic growth. The model has been extended to include various factors such as government spending, population growth, and taxation [2][3]. 

In the context of optimal taxation, the work by Saez [4] is particularly relevant. The Saez Optimal Taxation model provides a framework for dynamic taxation but does not fully account for taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior. Our work addresses these limitations by integrating large language models (LLMs) with agent-based modeling (ABM) to design adaptive tax policies that take into account the complexities of taxpayer behavior.

The use of ABM in economics has been growing, as it allows for the simulation of complex systems and the study of emergent behavior [5]. By incorporating heterogeneous agents that simulate real-world taxpayer behaviors, our study builds on this literature and provides a more nuanced understanding of the effects of taxation on economic inequality.

The concept of spatial Ramsey models [6], which introduce a spatial dimension to the traditional Ramsey model, is also relevant to our work. These models study the mobility of capital across space and have implications for regional economic growth and inequality. While our study does not directly focus on spatial aspects, it contributes to the broader literature on economic growth and inequality.

Our approach, which combines LLMs with ABM, is novel in the context of taxation policy design. Recent studies have explored the use of machine learning and LLMs in economics [7][8], but their application to taxation policy design is still in its infancy. This study offers a scalable, data-driven framework for fiscal policy evaluation and provides a new solution for addressing economic inequality through adaptive taxation.

The challenge of designing adaptive tax policies to address economic inequality has been a longstanding concern in the field of economics. Traditional tax systems, such as the U.S. federal income tax, aim to reduce inequality but often lack the adaptability required to effectively respond to dynamic economic conditions [1]. 

Optimal taxation models, such as the Saez Optimal Taxation framework, have been proposed to dynamically adjust tax policies [2]. However, these models have limitations, including failing to account for taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior. 

Recent studies have explored the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to design more effective tax policies. For instance, a study [3] proposed a two-level deep reinforcement learning approach to learn dynamic tax policies that balance economic equality and productivity. Their approach used economic simulations with adaptive agents and government, learning from observational data alone.

Another line of research has focused on integrating large language models (LLMs) with agent-based modeling (ABM) to design adaptive policies. While not directly applied to taxation, this integration has shown promise in other domains [4][5].

The use of agent-based modeling to simulate real-world taxpayer behaviors has also been explored [3]. In this context, heterogeneous agents (households) can be simulated to capture the diversity of taxpayer behaviors, and a government agent can utilize LLMs to iteratively optimize tax rates.

Our work builds upon these efforts, introducing TaxAgent, a novel integration of LLMs with ABM to design adaptive tax policies. We benchmark our approach against traditional tax systems, such as the Saez Optimal Taxation framework and U.S. federal income taxes, as well as free markets [2].

The challenge of economic inequality and the quest for adaptive, equitable, and efficient tax policies have been extensively explored in the literature. Traditional tax systems, such as the U.S. federal income tax, aim to reduce inequality but often lack the adaptability required to address dynamic economic conditions and taxpayer behavior [1]. 

Optimal taxation models, like the Saez Optimal Taxation, have been influential in proposing dynamic adjustments to tax policies [2]. However, these models have limitations, particularly in addressing taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior, which are critical for effective policy design. Recent advancements in integrating large language models (LLMs) with agent-based modeling (ABM) offer promising avenues for more nuanced and adaptive policy simulations.

The use of ABM in economic policy analysis allows for the simulation of complex interactions among heterogeneous agents, capturing emergent behaviors and outcomes that traditional models might overlook [3]. For instance, ABM has been applied to study the impact of fiscal policies on economic outcomes, including industrial investment and growth [4]. 

In the context of adaptive tax policies, the integration of LLMs with ABM, as proposed in this study, represents a novel approach. LLMs can process vast amounts of data and provide insights into taxpayer behavior, enabling more informed and dynamic policy adjustments [5]. This approach aligns with the growing interest in leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence for fiscal policy evaluation and design [6].

Studies on fiscal incentives and their impact on industrial investment also highlight the importance of a stable macroeconomic environment, public investment, and access to credit [7]. The findings suggest that fiscal incentives, when combined with broader economic reforms, can effectively promote industrial development in emerging economies. 

The TaxAgent framework, introduced in this study, builds on these insights by offering a scalable, data-driven approach to fiscal policy evaluation. By simulating real-world taxpayer behaviors and iteratively optimizing tax rates, TaxAgent aims to achieve superior equity-efficiency trade-offs compared to traditional tax systems and optimal taxation models [1].

The challenge of economic inequality and the quest for adaptive, equitable, and efficient tax policies have been extensively explored in the literature. Traditional tax systems, such as the U.S. federal income tax, aim to reduce inequality but often lack the flexibility to adapt to changing economic conditions and individual behaviors [1]. 

Dynamic models like the Saez Optimal Taxation have been proposed to address these limitations, but they typically fail to account for taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior [2]. In contrast, our study introduces TaxAgent, a novel integration of large language models (LLMs) with agent-based modeling (ABM) to design adaptive tax policies that balance equity and productivity.

The use of ABM in economics has been well-established, particularly in studying complex systems and emergent behaviors [3]. For instance, kinetic models have been employed to explain the emergence of income profiles from individual economic interactions, taking into account binary and ternary interactions that represent taxation and redistribution effects [4]. These models provide valuable insights into the effects of different fiscal policies on long-run income distributions.

Recent studies have also explored the application of machine learning and artificial intelligence in fiscal policy evaluation [5]. The integration of LLMs with ABM, as in our TaxAgent framework, offers a promising approach to designing more effective and adaptive tax policies.

Our work builds upon and contributes to the existing literature on adaptive tax policies, taxpayer behavior, and fiscal policy evaluation. By leveraging the strengths of LLMs and ABM, we aim to provide a more comprehensive and scalable framework for addressing economic inequality.

The problem of designing optimal tax policies has been extensively studied in the literature, with a particular focus on addressing taxpayer behavior and heterogeneity. Traditional approaches, such as the Saez Optimal Taxation model [1], provide a framework for dynamic tax policy optimization but often fail to account for taxpayer irrationality and heterogeneity. Recent studies have emphasized the importance of incorporating behavioral aspects into tax policy design [2].

The use of agent-based modeling (ABM) has gained popularity in simulating taxpayer behavior and evaluating tax policies [3]. For instance, ABM has been employed to study the impact of tax evasion on government revenues [4]. However, these models often rely on simplifying assumptions, such as risk-neutrality, which may not accurately capture taxpayer behavior.

The integration of large language models (LLMs) with ABM, as proposed in this study, offers a novel approach to designing adaptive tax policies. This approach has been explored in recent studies, which have demonstrated the potential of LLMs in optimizing complex systems [5]. The use of LLMs in tax policy design can provide a more nuanced understanding of taxpayer behavior and preferences.

Our work builds on existing research in tax policy optimization, ABM, and LLMs. Specifically, we draw on the work of [3], who used Q-learning and Deep Reinforcement Learning to study taxpayer behavior in a government-controlled tax environment. We also relate to [6], who proposed a framework for evaluating tax policies using ABM.

The TaxAgent framework proposed in this study offers a scalable and data-driven approach to fiscal policy evaluation. Our results demonstrate the potential of this approach in achieving superior equity-efficiency trade-offs compared to traditional tax systems.

The challenge of designing effective and adaptive tax policies to address economic inequality has been a longstanding concern in the field of economics. Traditional tax systems, such as the U.S. federal income tax, aim to reduce inequality but often lack the adaptability required to respond to dynamic economic conditions [1]. 

Optimal taxation models, such as the Saez Optimal Taxation model, have been proposed to adjust tax rates dynamically based on economic conditions [2]. However, these models have limitations, particularly in addressing taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior. Recent studies have emphasized the importance of incorporating behavioral aspects into tax policy design [3].

The integration of large language models (LLMs) with agent-based modeling (ABM) has shown promise in simulating complex economic systems and optimizing policy interventions [4]. For instance, ABM has been used to study the impact of fiscal policies on macroeconomic outcomes, including the effects of government spending and taxation on economic growth and inequality [5].

In the context of fiscal policy evaluation, Structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) models have been widely used to analyze the effects of fiscal shocks on the economy [6]. However, the choice of proxy variables in SVARs can significantly affect the results, and endogenous proxy variables can lead to biased conclusions [7]. 

Recent advancements in Bayesian non-Gaussian SVAR models have improved the handling of potentially endogenous proxy variables, offering a more nuanced understanding of fiscal policy effects [8]. Moreover, the use of LLMs in macroeconomic modeling has shown potential in capturing complex interactions between economic agents and policy interventions [9].

Our study builds on these advancements, introducing a novel integration of LLMs with ABM to design adaptive tax policies that address taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior. By benchmarking our approach against existing models, such as the Saez Optimal Taxation model and U.S. federal income taxes, we demonstrate the potential of our framework to achieve superior equity-efficiency trade-offs in tax policy design.

The study of economic inequality and its mitigation through taxation policies has garnered significant attention in recent years. Traditional tax systems, such as the U.S. federal income tax, aim to reduce inequality but often lack adaptability to changing economic conditions [1]. More dynamic models, like the Saez Optimal Taxation, have been proposed to address these limitations but still fall short in accounting for taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior [2].

Agent-based modeling (ABM) has emerged as a valuable tool for simulating complex economic systems and evaluating the impact of policy interventions. For instance, studies have explored the effects of stochastic resetting and tax-like dynamics on wealth distribution among agents, revealing interesting features such as transitions from poverty to wealth concentration [3]. These models often assume homogeneous agent characteristics, but real-world applications require consideration of heterogeneity.

The integration of large language models (LLMs) with ABM offers a promising approach to designing adaptive tax policies that account for taxpayer behavior and heterogeneity. This approach enables the simulation of real-world taxpayer behaviors and the optimization of tax rates to balance equity and productivity. Our work builds upon this idea, introducing TaxAgent, a novel integration of LLMs with ABM to design adaptive tax policies.

Several studies have investigated the impact of taxation on economic inequality using ABM. For example, [4] and [5] have explored the effects of taxation on wealth distribution and economic growth. These studies demonstrate the potential of ABM to inform policy decisions and evaluate the effectiveness of taxation policies.

Our work contributes to this growing body of research by introducing a novel approach to designing adaptive tax policies that account for taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior. We benchmark our approach against existing models, such as Saez Optimal Taxation, and demonstrate its superior equity-efficiency trade-offs.

The relationship between economic activity, intervention, and policy has been a longstanding area of research. Our work builds upon the understanding that monetary and fiscal policies are interlinked with economic dynamics, including unemployment, investment, consumption, and inflation [1]. The importance of balancing monetary injection between consumption and wages loop, and investment and returns loop, to optimize growth, has been emphasized [1]. 

Economic inequality is a pressing global challenge that affects education, healthcare, and social stability. Traditional taxation systems, such as the U.S. federal income tax, aim to reduce inequality but often lack adaptability [2]. Dynamic models like the Saez Optimal Taxation have been proposed to adjust tax policies dynamically, but they fail to account for taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior [2]. 

Our approach integrates large language models (LLMs) with agent-based modeling (ABM) to design adaptive tax policies, addressing the limitations of traditional systems and dynamic models. The use of LLMs and ABM in fiscal policy evaluation has shown promise in optimizing tax rates and balancing equity and productivity [3]. 

The concept of taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior has been explored in the literature, highlighting the need for more nuanced and adaptive tax policies [4]. Our work builds upon these findings, introducing a novel integration of LLMs with ABM to simulate real-world taxpayer behaviors and optimize tax rates.

The use of agent-based modeling in macroeconomic simulations has been widely adopted, allowing for the analysis of complex economic systems and the evaluation of policy interventions [5]. Our work leverages this approach, utilizing H-Agents (households) to simulate real-world taxpayer behaviors and the TaxAgent (government) to iteratively optimize tax rates.

The challenge of economic inequality and the quest for adaptive tax policies have been extensively explored in the literature. Traditional tax systems, such as the U.S. federal income tax, aim to reduce inequality but often lack the adaptability required to address dynamic economic changes [1]. 

Several studies have focused on optimizing tax policies to balance equity and productivity. The Saez Optimal Taxation model is a notable example, which adjusts tax rates dynamically based on taxpayer income [2]. However, such models have limitations, particularly in addressing taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior.

Recent advancements in integrating large language models (LLMs) with agent-based modeling (ABM) offer promising avenues for designing more adaptive and responsive tax policies. For instance, bilevel programming problems, which involve a leader-follower game structure, have been applied in environmental economics to optimize taxation and extraction decisions [3]. 

The concept of using LLMs to optimize tax rates iteratively, taking into account heterogeneous agent behaviors, aligns with the growing body of research on intelligent and data-driven fiscal policy evaluation. The use of agent-based models to simulate real-world behaviors and optimize policy interventions has shown potential in achieving better equity-efficiency trade-offs [4].

Furthermore, the integration of LLMs with ABM can enhance the adaptability and responsiveness of tax policies to changing economic conditions. This approach enables policymakers to evaluate the impact of different tax policies on various socioeconomic groups and make informed decisions [5].

The issue of economic inequality and its mitigation through fiscal policies, particularly taxation, has been a longstanding concern in economic research. Traditional taxation systems, such as the U.S. federal income tax, aim to reduce inequality but often lack the flexibility to adapt to changing economic conditions or individual taxpayer behaviors [1]. 

Dynamic taxation models, like the Saez Optimal Taxation model, have been proposed to address these limitations by adjusting tax rates based on taxpayer income and elasticity [2]. However, these models have limitations, including not fully accounting for taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior, which can significantly impact the effectiveness of tax policies.

Recent advancements in integrating large language models (LLMs) with agent-based modeling (ABM) offer promising avenues for more nuanced and adaptive policy design. The concept of using LLMs to optimize tax rates based on simulations of real-world taxpayer behaviors, as in the TaxAgent model, reflects a growing interest in leveraging artificial intelligence for fiscal policy evaluation [3].

The idea of creating a more direct monetary circuit that ties government finances to commercial activity, potentially combating inequality, has been explored in the context of modern monetary theory [4]. This theory suggests that by modifying the rationale for cancellation of principal in banking and crediting money to local/state governments or at-risk loans, an additional virtuous monetary circuit can be created. This circuit could potentially maintain and strengthen the current monetary circuit, directly linking government finances with commercial activity.

The use of agent-based modeling to simulate taxpayer behavior and optimize tax policies is a methodology that has seen increasing application in economic research [5]. By simulating heterogeneous agents (such as households) and their interactions, researchers can model complex economic systems and evaluate the impacts of different policy interventions.

The TaxAgent model, by integrating LLMs with ABM, offers a novel approach to designing adaptive tax policies that balance equity and productivity. Its benchmarking against traditional taxation systems and optimal taxation models, such as the Saez Optimal Taxation, highlights its potential for achieving superior equity-efficiency trade-offs [2].

Our work builds on these studies by introducing TaxAgent, a novel integration of LLMs with ABM to design adaptive tax policies. Similar to [6], we utilize LLMs to iteratively optimize tax rates, balancing equity and productivity. However, our approach incorporates heterogeneous agents (H-Agents) to simulate real-world taxpayer behaviors, addressing the limitations of traditional tax models.

The use of hybrid approaches, combining natural language interfaces with domain-specific languages, has also been explored in the context of tax loopholes and avoidance [7]. Our work complements these efforts by providing a scalable, data-driven framework for fiscal policy evaluation.

The challenge of economic inequality and the quest for optimal taxation strategies have been extensively explored in economic literature. Traditional taxation systems, such as the U.S. federal income tax, aim to reduce inequality but often lack the adaptability required to address dynamic economic changes [1]. 

Several studies have proposed dynamic models to optimize taxation, considering factors like taxpayer behavior and economic productivity. The Saez Optimal Taxation model is a notable example, which adjusts tax rates based on economic conditions but does not fully account for taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior [2]. 

In contrast, our study introduces a novel approach by integrating large language models (LLMs) with agent-based modeling (ABM) to design adaptive tax policies. This approach allows for a more nuanced simulation of real-world taxpayer behaviors and optimizes tax rates to balance equity and productivity. 

The concept of optimal taxation and its impact on economic growth and inequality has been explored in various theoretical models. For instance, a study [Snippet] proposed a stylized model of the economy with a public and private sector coupled through a wealth tax and redistribution policy. This model demonstrated that the optimal wealth tax rate can range from 0% to 100%, depending on the relative performance of the public and private sectors [Snippet]. 

Furthermore, the explore/exploit trade-off has been identified as a key mechanism in achieving optimal economic growth [Snippet]. This trade-off is relevant to our study, as the TaxAgent framework aims to balance the trade-off between equity and productivity in taxation.

The use of agent-based modeling (ABM) in economics has gained significant attention in recent years, particularly in simulating complex economic systems and evaluating policy interventions [3]. Our study builds on this literature by integrating ABM with LLMs to design adaptive tax policies.

The intersection of economic policy, agent-based modeling (ABM), and large language models (LLMs) represents a burgeoning area of research, particularly in addressing complex challenges such as economic inequality and adaptive fiscal policy design. Our work, introducing TaxAgent, a novel integration of LLMs with ABM for designing adaptive tax policies, builds upon a foundation laid by previous studies.

Research in macroeconomic modeling and policy evaluation has increasingly turned to agent-based models to capture the heterogeneity of economic agents and the complexity of their interactions [1]. These models allow for the simulation of various policy scenarios, providing insights into potential outcomes that traditional models might overlook. For instance, epidemiological models have been used to study the impact of policy interventions on the spread of diseases and their economic consequences [2].

The use of LLMs in economic policy design is a more recent development, offering a promising avenue for enhancing the adaptability and responsiveness of fiscal policies. By integrating LLMs with ABM, researchers can explore a wider range of policy scenarios and taxpayer behaviors, leading to more nuanced and effective policy recommendations [3].

Our approach, focusing on the integration of LLMs with ABM for taxation, echoes the efforts to leverage advanced computational methods for optimizing tax policies. The Saez Optimal Taxation model, for example, provides a framework for dynamic tax policy optimization but does not account for taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior to the extent that our model does [4].

Studies on the economic impacts of COVID-19 have also underscored the importance of timely and targeted policy interventions. For example, research on the effects of containment policies and fiscal responses during the pandemic highlights the critical role of early action and the balance between public health and economic outcomes [5].

The concept of using counterfactual scenarios to evaluate policy effectiveness is well-established, with applications across various fields, including epidemiology and economics. This methodological approach allows researchers to compare actual policy outcomes with hypothetical scenarios, providing valuable insights into policy efficacy [6].

Our work contributes to this body of research by introducing a scalable, data-driven framework for fiscal policy evaluation that integrates LLMs with ABM. By benchmarking TaxAgent against existing models and policies, such as the Saez Optimal Taxation and U.S. federal income taxes, we demonstrate the potential of this integrated approach to achieve superior equity-efficiency trade-offs in taxation.
