Only include references from arXiv that are published before 2025-06-03T13:06:19+00:00. Mention them in a separate, numbered reference list at the end and use the reference numbers to provide in-line citations in the Related Works section for all claims referring to a source (e.g., description of source [3]. Further details [6][7][8][9][10].) Each in-line citation must consist of a single reference number within a pair of brackets. Do not use any other citation format. Do not exceed 600 words for the related works section. Here is the paper abstract:\nEconomic inequality is a global challenge, intensifying disparities in\neducation, healthcare, and social stability. Traditional systems like the U.S.\nfederal income tax reduce inequality but lack adaptability. Although models\nlike the Saez Optimal Taxation adjust dynamically, they fail to address\ntaxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior. This study introduces TaxAgent,\na novel integration of large language models (LLMs) with agent-based modeling\n(ABM) to design adaptive tax policies. In our macroeconomic simulation,\nheterogeneous H-Agents (households) simulate real-world taxpayer behaviors\nwhile the TaxAgent (government) utilizes LLMs to iteratively optimize tax\nrates, balancing equity and productivity. Benchmarked against Saez Optimal\nTaxation, U.S. federal income taxes, and free markets, TaxAgent achieves\nsuperior equity-efficiency trade-offs. This research offers a novel taxation\nsolution and a scalable, data-driven framework for fiscal policy evaluation..",
    "description": "Economic inequality and the design of effective tax policies have been central topics in economics, with a rich literature spanning theoretical, computational, and empirical approaches. Traditional tax systems, such as the U.S. federal income tax, have long been used to mitigate inequality, but their static nature and limited adaptability have prompted the development of more dynamic frameworks and computational models to better address the complexities of real-world economies.",

However, it has been shown that the Mirrlees paradigm, which focuses on maximizing total utility, often fails to produce progressive tax schedules and may even assign minimal tax rates to higher-income groups, contradicting the ethical and practical expectations in developed economies.
