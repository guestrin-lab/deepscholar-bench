Economic inequality and the design of effective, adaptive tax policies have been central topics in computational economics, agent-based modeling, and artificial intelligence research. This section reviews key contributions in these areas, focusing on agent-based simulations of tax and redistribution, the integration of machine learning and reinforcement learning for fiscal policy, and the evolution of optimal taxation frameworks.

### Agent-Based and Computational Models of Taxation and Inequality

Agent-based modeling (ABM) has become a prominent approach for studying the emergence and mitigation of economic inequality. Early ABM studies demonstrated that wealth and income distributions observed empirically can be reproduced through simple models of agent interactions, with taxation and redistribution mechanisms playing a critical role in shaping steady-state inequality. For example, kinetic exchange models have shown that redistributive taxation can significantly reduce inequality, even in the presence of spatial segregation or heterogeneous agent interactions, whereas individual saving propensities alone are insufficient to counteract inequality in segregated economies \[[Lennart Fernandes' 2020-03-04](http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04129v1)\]. Extensions of these models have incorporated non-uniform income redistribution policies and tax evasion, finding that well-designed redistribution and strict control of tax planning are essential for promoting more egalitarian and sustainable societies \[[Iago Nascimento Barros' 2025-01-15](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08573v1)\].

Further, micro-to-macro kinetic models have been developed to explain the emergence of income profiles from individual interactions, with ternary interactions representing taxation and redistribution. Computational simulations using these models have shown that the Gini index is more sensitive to reductions in welfare and subsidies for the rich than to increases in upper tax rates, suggesting that targeted welfare policies can be more effective in reducing inequality \[[Maria Letizia Bertotti' 2014-05-29](http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.3749v2)\]. Other studies have explored the effects of tax dynamics in systems with stochastic resetting, revealing that increasing taxation can transition a society from one dominated by poverty to one where wealth is more evenly distributed, with optimal taxation levels producing complete economic equality under certain conditions \[[Ion Santra' 2022-02-28](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.13713v1)\].

### Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and AI-Driven Tax Policy

Recent advances have leveraged machine learning and reinforcement learning to design and evaluate adaptive tax policies. The AI Economist framework introduced a two-level deep reinforcement learning approach, where both agents and a government learn and adapt within a simulated economy. This approach enables the discovery of tax policies that improve the trade-off between equality and productivity, outperforming traditional frameworks such as the Saez Optimal Taxation model. Notably, AI-driven tax policies set higher top tax rates and provide greater net subsidies for low incomes, and they remain robust against emergent tax-gaming strategies by agents \[[Stephan Zheng' 2020-04-28](http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13332v1)\]. Similar approaches have used deep Q-learning to model the tax evasion behavior of risk-averse firms, providing a testbed for evaluating tax policies and offering policy recommendations based on simulated taxpayer responses \[[Nikolaos D. Goumagias' 2018-01-29](http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.09466v1)\].

Agent-based simulations powered by large language models (LLMs) and deep reinforcement learning have also been proposed to study the organic emergence of informal economic behaviors, such as tax evasion, without presupposing their existence. These frameworks allow for the exploration of socio-economic determinants of compliance, highlighting the complementary roles of efficient public goods provision and robust enforcement mechanisms in curtailing informal activity \[[Teddy Lazebnik' 2025-01-30](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18177v1)\]. Multi-agent economic models with reinforcement learning agents of various types have been used to investigate the impact of tax credit allocation on household behavior, demonstrating that strategic distribution of tax credits can ameliorate inequalities across households \[[Jialin Dong' 2023-11-28](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17252v1)\].

### Optimal Taxation Theory and Extensions

The theory of optimal taxation, notably the Mirrlees model, has long provided a foundation for tax policy design. However, it has been observed that the Mirrlees paradigm, which maximizes total utility, often fails to produce progressive tax schedules consistent with ethical and practical considerations in developed economies. Recent work has proposed augmenting the objective function with the standard deviation of utility, analogous to portfolio optimization, to yield more transparent and interpretable optimality criteria for income tax \[[Vassili N. Kolokoltsov' 2024-08-10](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14476v1)\]. Kinetic models for optimal control of wealth inequalities have introduced model predictive control strategies to minimize wealth variance, offering alternative theoretical approaches to taxation and redistribution at the macro level \[[Bertram Düring' 2018-03-06](http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02171v2)\].

Dynamic approaches to optimal taxation have drawn analogies to physical processes, such as the heat equation, to describe the smoothing of tax burdens across incomes. The "fairness principle" posits that the optimal tax at any income is a weighted average of optimal taxes at other incomes, providing a unified framework for reforming nonlinear income tax schedules \[[Stefan Steinerberger' 2019-04-30](http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.13276v1)\]. Other studies have analytically solved models coupling public and private sectors through wealth tax and redistribution, identifying conditions under which optimal tax rates maximize economic growth while balancing residual inequality \[[Jean-Philippe Bouchaud' 2015-08-02](http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.00275v2)\].

### Fiscal Policy, Redistribution, and Social Welfare

The broader literature on fiscal policy emphasizes the importance of redistribution and government intervention in reducing inequality and promoting social welfare. Computational analyses have shown that the financial accumulation process, particularly compound returns, is a major driver of inequality, but institutional arrangements such as taxation can significantly shape aggregate economic outcomes \[[Simone Righi' 2019-01-13](http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.03951v1)\]. Fiscal policy models with endogenous positional concerns demonstrate that government consumption funded by taxes on labor income and wealth can move economies toward egalitarian equilibria, even when initial inequality is high \[[Kirill Borissov' 2021-07-01](http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00410v1)\]. Simulations of service economies with random transactions have highlighted the influence of tax rates and government spending on economic behavior, sales, and overall stability \[[Robert W. Easton' 2011-02-01](http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.0312v1)\].

Empirical and simulation-based studies have also examined the effectiveness of fiscal multipliers, finding that increasing government spending is generally more effective in stimulating the economy than reducing taxes \[[Sascha A. Keweloh' 2023-02-25](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13066v5)\]. During economic crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, agent-based macroeconomic-epidemiological models have shown that anticyclical fiscal policy—expansionary government spending during downturns—can limit economic losses and support rapid recovery without increasing mortality \[[Patrick Mellacher' 2020-11-12](http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06289v1)\]. The balance between monetary and fiscal policy, particularly the allocation of government support to lower-income households, has been identified as crucial for optimizing growth and investment opportunities \[[Yaneer Bar-Yam' 2017-10-17](http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06285v2)\].

### Tax Evasion, Loopholes, and Enforcement

Tax evasion and avoidance remain persistent challenges in the design of equitable tax systems. Agent-based and reinforcement learning models have been used to simulate the emergence and dynamics of tax evasion, revealing that individual personality traits, external narratives, enforcement probabilities, and perceptions of public goods provision all influence compliance behavior \[[Teddy Lazebnik' 2025-01-30](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18177v1)\]\[[Nikolaos D. Goumagias' 2018-01-29](http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.09466v1)\]. AI-driven systems have been developed to systematically identify and address tax loopholes, enhancing social welfare by closing gaps in tax policy \[[Peter Fratrič' 2025-03-21](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17339v1)\]. The interplay between enforcement, audit probabilities, and taxpayer risk aversion has been explored to inform the design of more effective tax policies \[[Nikolaos D. Goumagias' 2018-01-29](http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.09466v1)\].

### Multi-Objective and Environmental Taxation

Beyond traditional income and wealth taxation, multi-objective optimization frameworks have been applied to environmental taxation and resource extraction. Differential game and Stackelberg game approaches model the interaction between government regulators and private firms, balancing objectives such as tax revenue maximization and environmental damage minimization. Analytical and evolutionary algorithm solutions provide optimal taxation and extraction strategies under various scenarios \[[Moustapha Pemy' 2016-10-27](http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02547v2)\]\[[Ankur Sinha' 2013-07-23](http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.6250v1)\]. In the context of climate policy, constrained efficient carbon taxation has been studied in heterogeneous agent models, with financial frictions and cost-sharing schemes significantly affecting optimal abatement levels and distributional outcomes \[[Felix Kübler' 2022-10-17](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09066v1)\].

### Conclusion

The intersection of agent-based modeling, machine learning, and optimal taxation theory has produced a rich body of research on adaptive tax policy and economic inequality. Recent advances demonstrate the potential of integrating large language models and reinforcement learning within agent-based simulations to design tax policies that dynamically balance equity and productivity, address taxpayer heterogeneity, and remain robust to strategic behavior. These developments provide a foundation for scalable, data-driven frameworks for fiscal policy evaluation and highlight the importance of continued interdisciplinary research in this domain.
