The challenge of economic inequality is a pressing global issue, affecting education, healthcare, and social stability [1]. Traditional taxation systems, such as the U.S. federal income tax, aim to mitigate inequality but often lack adaptability to changing economic conditions and individual behaviors [0]. In response, various models have been proposed to optimize tax policies, including the Saez Optimal Taxation framework, which adjusts tax rates dynamically to balance equity and productivity [27].

However, existing models like Saez's often fail to account for taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior, which are crucial factors in determining the effectiveness of tax policies [6]. Recent studies have emphasized the importance of incorporating behavioral aspects into tax policy design, using techniques such as agent-based modeling (ABM) [12][14]. ABM allows for the simulation of complex interactions between heterogeneous agents, providing insights into emergent behaviors and outcomes.

The integration of large language models (LLMs) with ABM has shown promise in optimizing policy design, including taxation [19]. LLMs can process vast amounts of data and provide adaptive, data-driven solutions to complex problems [20]. By combining LLMs with ABM, researchers can create more realistic and responsive models of economic systems. This approach enables the simulation of dynamic interactions between governments, households, and firms, allowing for the evaluation of tax policies in a more nuanced and realistic context.

For instance, TaxAI, a multi-agent reinforcement learning environment, has been developed to simulate dynamic games between governments, households, and firms [19]. Similarly, the AI Economist framework uses reinforcement learning to optimize tax policies in dynamic economic environments [18]. Additionally, Atlas, a retrieval-augmented language model, has demonstrated effectiveness in reducing hallucinations and improving parameter efficiency compared to non-retrieval augmented LMs [2].

In comparison to these approaches, TaxAgent offers a more comprehensive framework for tax policy design, incorporating both LLMs and ABM to simulate real-world taxpayer behaviors and optimize tax rates [abstract]. While TaxAI and the AI Economist focus on specific aspects of tax policy design, such as dynamic games and reinforcement learning, TaxAgent provides a more integrated approach, balancing equity and productivity in a more realistic and responsive economic environment.

The advantages of integrating LLMs with ABM include the ability to capture complex behaviors and interactions, as well as to provide adaptive and data-driven solutions [19]. However, there are also limitations to this approach, such as the need for high-quality data and the potential for biased outcomes if the LLMs are not properly trained [20].

In terms of applications, TaxAgent's performance can be evaluated in various economic sectors, such as labor markets [24], capital markets [25], and international trade [26]. Furthermore, its impact on economic stability and racial justice can be assessed in different countries, including low-income countries [7]. By examining TaxAgent's performance in diverse scenarios, policymakers can gain insights into its potential to address economic inequality and promote social welfare.

Our study builds on this literature by introducing TaxAgent, a novel integration of LLMs with ABM, designed to optimize adaptive tax policies that balance equity and productivity. By benchmarking TaxAgent against traditional tax systems, such as the Saez Optimal Taxation framework and the U.S. federal income tax, we demonstrate the potential of this approach to achieve superior equity-efficiency trade-offs.

Finally, states can adapt Dorothy Brown's proposal for federal income tax reform by "[eliminating exclusions, reducing deductions, and returning to a single progressive tax system" in their state tax codes (Brown 2021, 206). Together, these proposals offer more efficient and equitable sources of revenue than court debt. When reformulating their tax systems, states and municipalities should consider racial equity. Given the racial disparities of the current tax system, policymakers should prioritize policies aimed at building minority wealth and ending subsidies to the white and wealthy (Brown 2021;Steverman 2021). Eliminating many of the barriers to taxation discussed earlier can promote both economic stability and racial justice. Many barriers to taxation, such as supermajority requirements for tax increases and property tax limits, originated during the Jim Crow and Reconstruction Eras, respectively (Leachman et al. 2018. Similarly, Mississippi introduced the first modern American sales tax in 1932 to produce "a reduction in taxes owed by mostly white property owners and an increase in those owed by Black households that owned little or no property and had little else to tax" (ibid., 2). Conversely, elimination of such barriers can serve as a repudiation of the racist

[2] In this work we present Atlas, a carefully designed and pre-trained retrieval augmented language model able to learn knowledge intensive tasks with very few training examples. We perform evaluations on a wide range of tasks, including MMLU, KILT and NaturalQuestions, and study the impact of the content of the document index, showing that it can easily be updated. Notably, Atlas reaches over 42% accuracy on Natural Questions using only 64 examples, outperforming a 540B parameters model by 3% despite having 50x fewer parameters.

[6] Much less vast, but closely related to our paper, is the literature studying the role of microeconomic heterogeneity at shaping the interaction between the epidemic and the economy. Considering heterogeneity across households, Kaplan et al. (2020) integrate the SIR model into a framework with income and wealth inequality, as well as occupational and sectoral heterogeneity, to study the distributional and welfare effects associated with the US policy response to the pandemic. The health and economic policies they consider entail large and heterogeneous welfare costs across households. Hur (2020) integrates a SIR model into an heterogeneous agent-life cycle economy. He designs Pareto-improving mitigation policies, and shows that the latter can reduce deaths by nearly 60 percent relative to a no mitigation scenario. Eichenbaum et al. (2021) develop a two agents model consistent with the observation that the health of low wage workers has been disproportionately affected by the pandemic. Our paper is complementary to these analysis, since it considers heterogeneity in the supply side of the economy.

In the long run, tax law will reach functional completeness through these internal and external mechanisms. For now, however, the tax law is incomplete. This incompleteness means that taxpayers must often proceed without knowing for certain how the gaps in the tax law will be filled by tax policy makers, tax administrators, and (if it comes to that) judges. These various groups may not agree on whether and how our incompletely specified tax law will apply to the taxpayer's situation. Indeed, because taxation at the point of interpretation and application represents a zerosum transfer (some would argue a negative sum,

[19] Therefore, we propose a MARL environment, named \textbf{TaxAI}, for dynamic games involving $N$ households, government, firms, and financial intermediaries based on the Bewley-Aiyagari economic model. Our study benchmarks 2 traditional economic methods with 7 MARL methods on TaxAI, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of MARL algorithms. Moreover, TaxAI's scalability in simulating dynamic interactions between the government and 10,000 households, coupled with real-data calibration, grants it a substantial improvement in scale and reality over existing simulators. Therefore, TaxAI is the most realistic economic simulator for optimal tax policy, which aims to generate feasible recommendations for governments and individuals.

[22] The reviewed macroeconomic ABMs study distinct policies and policy mixes. But they have not much contributed to the long-standing debate on a double dividend (e.g., positive effects on employment and emissions reduction) of an environmental tax reform, that is, shifting taxes from labor to carbon (Goulder, 1995). This could add more insight about the particular role of bounded rationality and social interactions, as well as the role of low-carbon innovation, which are missing in conventional general equilibrium studies that dominate this topic. Since ABMs describe multiple agents and heterogeneity, they are also well suited to address the role of inequality in relation to environmental tax reform. Next, the study of information provision strategies in climate policy is difficult in traditional equilibrium models but more straightforward in ABMs. Indeed, we find that several ABM studies in our review addressed this issue, particularly in the theme of energy conservation.

[24] behavioral responses (the Lucas critique). Moreover, existing simulation-based approaches often do not consider both strategic planners and agents, or interactions between actors (4-6). Such complex settings include income taxation (tax policy changes the post-tax utility that economic agents experience) and pandemics (Federal subsidies can lighten the economic burden on citizens and may incentivize US states to employ more stringent public health policies). As a case study, we show how our framework can optimize public health and economic policies for both public health (e.g., reducing COVID-19 deaths) and the economy (e.g., maintaining productivity) during a pandemic. Using real data, we simulate COVID-19, vaccinations, and unemployment in the United States.

[27] The specific tax rates set by these models are depicted in Figure . See the related work (Section . ) for a broader discussion on the various tax frameworks proposed in the optimal tax literature, including linear tax models and analytical approaches to dynamic taxation in sequential economies. All tax models set tax rates for a bracketed tax schedule, and use the same income brackets, following the US federal income tax schedule and scaling so that USD corresponds to Coin: Saez Tax Formula (single-period). A prominent analytical treatment of optimal taxation is given by Saez [ , who proposes a closed-form solution for optimal tax rates in a single-period economy.
