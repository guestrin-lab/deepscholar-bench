Refer to Smith and Baldwin (2015) for a detailed discussion of the Hardy-Weinberg principle. The Hardy-Weinberg principle is divided into two initial equations: 1. The allele frequency of two alleles at one locus for a monogenic Mendelian trait in the focal population is p + q = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele A and q is the frequency of the recessive allele a. 2. The expected genotype frequency of the focal population in genetic equilibrium is p 2 + 2pq + q 2 = 1, where p 2 is the TIPS, TRICKS & TECHNIQUES frequency of homozygous dominant individuals, 2pq is the frequency of heterozygous individuals, and q 2 is the frequency of homozygous recessive individuals. Once students have practiced equations 1 and 2, it is common to introduce two mechanisms of evolution that push populations out of genetic equilibrium: natural selection and mutation. These can be factored as extensions into the Hardy-Weinberg principle as a series of steps that demonstrate the rate of change per generation (modified from Emlen & Zimmer, 2020). Start first with natural selection: a.

Finally, states can adapt Dorothy Brown's proposal for federal income tax reform by \"[e]liminating exclusions, reducing deductions, and returning to a single progressive tax system\" in their state tax codes (Brown 2021, 206). Together, these proposals offer more efficient and equitable sources of revenue than court debt. When reformulating their tax systems, states and municipalities should consider racial equity. Given the racial disparities of the current tax system, policymakers should prioritize policies aimed at building minority wealth and ending subsidies to the white and wealthy (Brown 2021;Steverman 2021). Eliminating many of the barriers to taxation discussed earlier can promote both economic stability and racial justice. Many barriers to taxation, such as supermajority requirements for tax increases and property tax limits, originated during the Jim Crow and Reconstruction Eras, respectively (Leachman et al. 2018. Similarly, Mississippi introduced the first modern American sales tax in 1932 to produce \"a reduction in taxes owed by mostly white property owners and an increase in those owed by Black households that owned little or no property and had little else to tax\" (ibid., 2).

Such reforms can include \"[e]liminating supermajority requirements to raise revenues\" [r]epeal [ing] or reform[ing] rigid, formulaic property tax limits,\" \"[e]liminating other constitutional restrictions on raising revenue,\" and \"[s]trengthening state 'rainy day funds,'\" by",

This, in turn, provides the foundation for other economic and racial equity initiatives, such as \"provid[ing] more funding to schools serving larger shares of children living in poverty or facing other challenges\" (ibid., 21). Such an approach acknowledges and rejects the legacy of white supremacy. In so doing, it enables states and municipalities to pursue policies that further substantive equality, and with it, social justice. With respect to positive reforms, revitalizing property taxes is particularly promising (Hayashi and Kleiman 2020). But to formulate an efficient and equitable property tax, lawmakers must consider that residences in African American and Latino neighborhoods are consistently over-assessed, while residences in majority white neighborhoods are persistently under-assessed (Harris 2004, 2;Atuahene 2020, 111, 124, 179). This means that residents of minority neighborhoods likely bear a disproportionate tax burden for public goods funded by property taxes (Harris 2004, 2). Such a trend typifies the extractive and redistributive logics of both tax and court debt discussed earlier. To avoid replicating such harmful practices, governments can use assessments based on the actual cash costs (i.e., the purchase prices) of residential parcels of property, rather than market-based assessments (ibid., 5). These are just a small sample of potential policy responses. Other promising initiatives also deserve serious consideration (see, for example, Hanauer 2020). Yet, no matter the precise tools chosen, legislators must take care to prioritize both economic stability and racial equity when devising policies. Rejection",

In particular, our two sources of nonlinearity are able to generate what Adrian et al. (2016) and Adrian and Duarte (2016) call \"vulnerable growth\", i.e., highly left-skewed distribution of GDP growth correlated with financial leverage. Our contribution is to generate such vulnerable growth in a completely structural way. The nature of asymmetric distributions in our framework is comparable to Dupraz et al. (2017), who generate an asymmetric distribution of the unemployment rate by combining downward nominal wage rigidity and search frictions but abstract from income inequality and financial crises. Relatedly, Kocherlakota (2000) and Jensen et al. (2017) show that occasionally binding financial constraints in a highly leveraged economy can be an important source of business cycle asymmetries. While our paper also highlights the role of credit in generating asymmetric distributions, Kocherlakota (2000) and Jensen et al. (2017) abstract from nominal rigidities, which prevent the study of monetary policy. Importantly, to the best of our knowledge, the interaction between financial crises and the binding ZLB constraint in our paper is only found in Guerrieri and Lorenzoni (2017). In particular, they model an heterogeneous-agent incomplete-market economy in which deleveraging after a shock to borrowing capacity forces the real interest rate to fall to zero even with flexible prices.

The authors calibrate a model combining optimal nonlinear income taxation in the tradition of Mirrlees (1971) with discrete schooling choice in the tradition of Roy (1951), Willis and Rosen (1979), Heckman et al. (2006), and others. Both the paper of Findeisen et al. and the present paper assess the efficiency of education policy but choose different modeling strategies. While Findeisen et al. follow Mirrlees (1971) andBovenberg et al. (2005) in allowing for individual heterogeneity, the present paper is grounded in Ramsey's tradition and studies the efficiency of educational incentives in the framework of a representative taxpayer. Both modeling strategies have advantages and disadvantages. The model of Findeisen et al. is rich enough to incorporate multidimensional heterogeneity, idiosyncratic risk, and borrowing constraints. The downside of this complexity is simplicity in modeling details. For example, individual preferences are assumed to be quasi linear. Furthermore, psychic costs, which are not well understood, are pivotal for explaining schooling choice. By contrast, the present paper does not explicitly rely on psychic costs and builds on arbitrary utility functions. This level of generality comes at the cost of neglecting heterogeneity. However, we argue that disregarding individual heterogeneity is rather appropriate when analyzing policy issues. After all, tax and education policy is not designed for individuals or small groups characterized by distinct social criteria. Tax and education policy must set efficient incentives for individuals at large. Although we cannot determine the efficiency frontier with our data, we",

However, and this is in fact surprising, the rate of improvement appears to follow a pattern that is best fitted by a power function. \"It has been seen in pressing buttons, reading inverted text, rolling cigars, generating geometry proofs, and manufacturing machine tools\" (Ritter and Schooler, 2001). In neuroscience this is known as the power law of learning (Newell and Rosenbloom, 1981;Anderson, 2005). One of the early studies reporting detailed data is Blackburn (1936). The study reports the productivity of seven individuals accomplishing five specific tasks repeatedly. The individuals were asked to sort packs of 42 cards, to cross out all occurrences of the letter e in a nonsense text, to transform short texts by some rather complicated code substitution, to add digits, and to learn a stylus maze. Crossman (1959) confirms the power law of learning for the first four experiments, while raising doubts about the applicability for maze learning.

The authors calibrate a model combining optimal nonlinear income taxation in the tradition of Mirrlees (1971) with discrete schooling choice in the tradition of Roy (1951), Willis and Rosen (1979), Heckman et al. (2006), and others. Both the paper of Findeisen et al. and the present paper assess the efficiency of education policy but choose different modeling strategies. While Findeisen et al. follow Mirrlees (1971) andBovenberg et al. (2005) in allowing for individual heterogeneity, the present paper is grounded in Ramsey's tradition and studies the efficiency of educational incentives in the framework of a representative taxpayer. Both modeling strategies have advantages and disadvantages. The model of Findeisen et al. is rich enough to incorporate multidimensional heterogeneity, idiosyncratic risk, and borrowing constraints. The downside of this complexity is simplicity in modeling details. For example, individual preferences are assumed to be quasi linear. Furthermore, psychic costs, which are not well understood, are pivotal for explaining schooling choice. By contrast, the present paper does not explicitly rely on psychic costs and builds on arbitrary utility functions. This level of generality comes at the cost of neglecting heterogeneity. However, we argue that disregarding individual heterogeneity is rather appropriate when analyzing policy issues. After all, tax and education policy is not designed for individuals or small groups characterized by distinct social criteria. Tax and education policy must set efficient incentives for individuals at large. Although we cannot determine the efficiency frontier with our data, we",

Using 2005 DHS and 2011 DHS to compare education attainment for different age groups (in working age), we find that the young men and women were the most benefited from the rise in education levels. For instance, the share of females from 15 to 19 years of age with some secondary education jumped from 18 percent to 35 percent (while for males in the same age group it changed from 24 to 43 percent). For young women between 20 and 24 years of age, the percentage with some secondary education increased from 12 to 19 percent (while for males in the same age group it has risen from 21 to 29 percent). The survey also allows us to make estimations of the total increase in education of the working age population by level of income, and we find that the largest improvements in terms of percentage changes were in the bottom 60 percent of the income distribution ( Figure 1e), which had the lowest education attainment.

Having reduced the dynamic of wealth to this simple model, I apply the Kolmogorov (1931) forward equation, a standard result of stochastic calculus, which is known to be extremely useful in understanding how wealth distributions get their power-law shape (Gabaix, 2009). This equation relates how wealth evolves stochastically at the individual level with how the distribution of wealth evolves deterministically in the aggregate. Traditionally, this equation is used deductively: starting from a set of parameters for how individual wealth evolves, we apply it to determine how the distribution changes. This paper argues that it is possible to use that equation inductively. That is, looking at how the distribution changes, we can infer the parameters (the mean and the variance of savings) that govern the underlying individual wealth accumulation process. That we can infer the individual wealth accumulation process -including a mobility parameter -from cross-sectional data may prima facie be counterintuitive. This paper provides a simple explanation for that fact. Basically, mobility is a force that spreads out observations and, therefore, flattens the wealth density locally. Consequently, the changes it exerts on the distribution depend on how flat it is to begin with. In contrast, the local effect exerted by the drift (i.e., how much wealth grows at a given point on average) is akin to a local translation (Piketty and Saez, 2013a;Saez and Stantcheva, 2018). and is independent of the",

The empirical literature has attempted to overcome these challenges in various ways, most notably by using quasi-experimental methods and laboratory experiments 1 . For example, the growing bunching literature has used changes in the tax schedule to estimate income responses to increases in tax rates (for a review, see Saez et al., 2012). The results largely show that taxpayers avoid higher rates by keeping their reported income low-a response that is, at least partly, linked to evasion. Laboratory experiments largely confirm the negative relationship between the tax rate and reported income. A laboratory setting, where it is possible to vary the tax rate and measure evasion precisely, reported that income decreases when the tax rate increases (Alm, 2012;Torgler, 2002). Much of the compliance literature has focused on domestic taxes-for the most part, income taxes. However, the same question on tax rates and evasion has been central to the trade liberalisation debate too. While trade liberalisation refers to a broader set of issues, the reduction of tariff rates is a central element to it. A strand of the trade liberalisation literature has therefore investigated the revenue effects of such tariff reductions. The immediate mechanical effect of a decrease",

Importantly, trade liberalisation is indeed meant to stimulate more trade flows. Such an increase in trade volume may compensate, at least partly, for the revenue loss from lower tariffs. At the same time, much like in the domestic tax compliance literature, decreases in the rate of trade taxes may reduce evasion at the border. Estimating this relationship is particularly important in low-income countries (LICs), which face great pressure to liberalise trade while struggling to raise the necessary revenue to fund basic public spending. As a share of their economy, LICs typically raise lower tax than their higher-income counterparts and face higher evasion (Besley & Persson, 2014). The literature so far has shown that LICs have found it particularly hard to recoup lost revenue from trade liberalisation, compared with their higher-income counterparts (Baunsgaard & Keen, 2010;Cage & Gadenne, 2018). This paper contributes to these strands of literature and debates by providing new evidence on the relationship between the tax rate and trade tax evasion in an LIC: Ethiopia. We measure tax evasion as the trade gap. By comparing records of traded goods on the exporter and importer sides, we can identify the trade gap as the quantity or value of traded goods that appear to be exported from the trading partner but do not appear to have been received by the importing country (see Section 4 for more details). We then estimate the relationship between the",

The empirical literature has attempted to overcome these challenges in various ways, most notably by using quasi-experimental methods and laboratory experiments 1 . For example, the growing bunching literature has used changes in the tax schedule to estimate income responses to increases in tax rates (for a review, see Saez et al., 2012). The results largely show that taxpayers avoid higher rates by keeping their reported income low-a response that is, at least partly, linked to evasion. Laboratory experiments largely confirm the negative relationship between the tax rate and reported income. A laboratory setting, where it is possible to vary the tax rate and measure evasion precisely, reported that income decreases when the tax rate increases (Alm, 2012;Torgler, 2002). Much of the compliance literature has focused on domestic taxes-for the most part, income taxes. However, the same question on tax rates and evasion has been central to the trade liberalisation debate too. While trade liberalisation refers to a broader set of issues, the reduction of tariff rates is a central element to it. A strand of the trade liberalisation literature has therefore investigated the revenue effects of such tariff reductions. The immediate mechanical effect of a decrease",

The reviewed macroeconomic ABMs study distinct policies and policy mixes. But they have not much contributed to the long-standing debate on a double dividend (e.g., positive effects on employment and emissions reduction) of an environmental tax reform, that is, shifting taxes from labor to carbon (Goulder, 1995). This could add more insight about the particular role of bounded rationality and social interactions, as well as the role of low-carbon innovation, which are missing in conventional general equilibrium studies that dominate this topic. Since ABMs describe multiple agents and heterogeneity, they are also well suited to address the role of inequality in relation to environmental tax reform. Next, the study of information provision strategies in climate policy is difficult in traditional equilibrium models but more straightforward in ABMs. Indeed, we find that several ABM studies in our review addressed this issue, particularly in the theme of energy conservation. However, they do not span the full scope of relevant instruments: Information campaigns (targeting very distinct population groups), green awards, the role of traditional versus Internet-based social media, and regulation of advertising of high-carbon goods and services deserve attention as well.

Since it cannot be excluded that a transition to a low-carbon economy will involve fundamental changes in lifestyles and culture, it is pertinent to study the impact of a combination of climate policy and changing social norms on lifestyles. While ABMs are capable of studying changes in norms, lifestyle and culture, which has received some attention in other areas (Bianchi & Squazzoni, 2015;Jackson, Rand, & Lewis, 2017), the reviewed ABM studies of climate policy lack attention for this.

Generally, ABMs can be used to examine if and how lifestyles change under certain policy mixes.

But they have not much contributed to the long-standing debate on a double dividend (e.g., positive effects on employment and emissions reduction) of an environmental tax reform, that is, shifting taxes from labor to carbon (Goulder, 1995). This could add more insight about the particular role of bounded rationality and social interactions, as well as the role of low-carbon innovation, which are missing in conventional general equilibrium studies that dominate this topic. Since ABMs describe multiple agents and heterogeneity, they are also well suited to address the role of inequality in relation to environmental tax reform. Next, the study of information provision strategies in climate policy is difficult in traditional equilibrium models but more straightforward in ABMs. Indeed, we find that several ABM studies in our review addressed this issue, particularly in the theme of energy conservation. However, they do not span the full scope of relevant instruments: Information campaigns (targeting very distinct population groups), green awards, the role of traditional versus Internet-based social media, and regulation of advertising of high-carbon goods and services deserve attention as well. Additional research employing ABM could test whether it is more effective for emissions reduction to stimulate",

We studied the association between household income and clinical outcomes in AF hospitalizations. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of adult primary AF hospitalizations from the United States National Inpatient Sample (NIS) between 2016 and 2020. Quartile classification of the median household income of the zip code of the patient\u2019s residence provided by NIS was used. Among the four income quartiles, lowest quartile was used as reference category. Weighted multivariable logistic and linear regression, adjusting for multiple patient and hospital-level characteristics (Table 1), were performed. We aimed to study patient characteristics and clinical outcomes in AF based on household income. Results: From lowest to highest income quartile, mean age and proportion of White race increased; proportion of females, Black, and Hispanic race decreased (Table 1). Compared with lowest income residents, highest income residents had lower in-hospital mortality (Odds ratio [OR] 0.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.7, 0.87, P < 0.001), lower disposition to care facility (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.83-0.9, p < 0.001), lower length of stay (adjusted mean difference -0.26, 95% CI -0.30, -0.22, P < 0.001), higher procedure utilization including catheter and surgical ablation, atrial appendage closure, electrical cardioversion, and higher healthcare costs ($12,124 vs 10,018)(Table 1).

More stringent US state policy (e.g., closing down businesses more) may temper the spread of the pandemic (7,8), but may lead to lower productivity owing to higher unemployment. As a modeling assumption, the policy objective of US states depends on the level of federal subsidies: higher federal subsidies may incentivize US states to accept higher unemployment and be more stringent to reduce deaths. However, this may incur a higher national cost, e.g., through borrowing money. Hence, this presents a hard two-level optimization problem. Although the underlying public health and economic mechanics are complex, these correlations and trade-offs are salient in real data. We find that log-linear RL policies achieve significantly higher social welfare than baseline policies executed in simulation. These policies perform well across a wide range of relative weightings of public health and the economy, and demonstrate how the social planner can align US state incentives with national social welfare through subsidies. The policies are explainable: well-performing policies respond strongly to changes in recovery and vaccination rates, for example. Moreover, these results are robust to a range of calibration errors, e.g., infection rates that are over or underestimated. Our work is descriptive, not normative.

Using the calibrated model, I show that private mitigation plays a substantial role in reducing deaths and output during the pandemic, but there is large heterogeneity in the intensity of private mitigation across individuals. In particular, reductions in economic activities that contribute to the spread of COVID-19 are larger for individuals that are older, have higher wages, or have higher wealth. I also show that stay-at-home subsidies are superior to stay-at-home orders because they reduce deaths by more and output by less.

Investigating optimal mitigation policies that incorporate these and other sources of heterogeneity are left for future research. Conclusion In this paper, I developed a quantitative life cycle-economic epidemiology model that was used to measure the heterogeneous welfare consequences of COVID-19 and to investigate the properties of optimal mitigation policies. Using the calibrated model, I show that private mitigation plays a substantial role in reducing deaths and output during the pandemic, but there is large heterogeneity in the intensity of private mitigation across individuals. In particular, reductions in economic activities that contribute to the spread of COVID-19 are larger for individuals that are older, have higher wages, or have higher wealth. I also show that stay-at-home subsidies are superior to stay-at-home orders because they reduce deaths by more and output by less. Furthermore, Pareto improving policies can simultaneously improve economic and public health outcomes.

Introduction Economic inequality is accelerating globally and is a key social and economic concern. Many studies have shown that large income inequality gaps can have significant negative effects, leading for example to diminished economic opportunity [United Nations, ] and adverse health effects [Subramanian and Kawachi, ]. In this light, tax policy provides governments with an important tool to reduce inequality, supporting the possibility of the redistribution of wealth through government provided services and benefits. And yet, finding the optimal tax policy is challenging. The basic reason is that while more taxation can improve equality, taxation can also discourage people from working, leading to lower productivity. The problem of optimally balancing equality and productivity has not been solved for general economic settings, and even when the policy objectives can be agreed upon. Part of the challenge is that is hard to experiment with real-world tax policies. In the place of experimentation, economic theory often relies on simplifying assumptions that are hard to validate, for example about people's sensitivity to taxes. Tax systems that have been proposed range from no taxes at all (\"free market\"), to progressive and regressive tax systems (reflecting whether the tax rate increases or decreases as income increases), to total redistribution.

The Saez analysis assumes that behavioral changes of agents are To illustrate this, for the four agent, Open Quadrant scenario, a typical regression of observed taxes paid and reported incomes would estimate elasticity at around 0.87, see Methods for details. However, by evaluating the Saez tax over a wide range of elasticity values, we find that an assumed elasticity of around 3 optimizes social welfare when used in Saez's framework.

The \"Camelback\" policy achieves competitive equality-productivity and weighted social welfare (Equation ) in the AI-only simulations, compared to the Saez tax model. The productivity was lower in experiments with people. This is due to suboptimal human behavior, as well as lower human response times compared to AI agents. To ensure that all tax policies could still make use of the full range of tax brackets, we calibrated the income bracket cutoffs to approximately match the income bracket occupancy rates to those in the AI experiments, achieving this by scaling the income cutoffs down by a factor of three. The Experimental Protocol. We ran all experiments with US-based participants on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Participants performed HITs (Human Intelligence Task). Each HIT consists of a sequence of four episodes, with a tutorial before each episode, and a post-episode",

Here, the incentive constraints are represented through the rational behavior of agents, who optimize behavior subject to income tax and income redistribution. Our simulations run for a finite number of timesteps H and capture several key features of the Mirrleesian framework: that agents perform labor l in order to earn income z, where skill determines how much income an agent earns for a given amount of labor; that an agent's utility increases with its post-tax income and decreases with its labor; and that agents are heterogeneously skilled.

Nevertheless, given the stakes involved and the arms race between (on the one hand) governments seeking to preserve revenues and (on the other hand) taxpayers seeking to avoid taxation, it is inevitable that significant sums will continue to be invested both in the devising of means to avoid taxation and in continuing to articulate and implement tax law effectively. In a frequently cited passage of the Supreme Court of Canada's judgment in Stubart Investments, 52 Estey J identifies what is probably the most fundamental mechanism in the further development of tax law: These interpretative guidelines, modest though they may be, and which fall well short of the bona fide business purpose test advanced by the respondent, are in my view appropriate to reduce the action and reaction endlessly produced by complex, specific tax measures aimed at sophisticated business practices, and the inevitable, professionally-guided and equally specialized tax-payer reaction. Otherwise, where the substance of the Act, when the clause in question is contextually construed, is clear and unambiguous and there is no prohibition in the Act which embraces the taxpayer, the taxpayer shall be free to avail himself of the beneficial provision in question. 53 Ultimately, it is probably this fundamental and familiar dynamic between the taxpayer and",

In the long run, tax law will reach functional completeness through these internal and external mechanisms. For now, however, the tax law is incomplete. This incompleteness means that taxpayers must often proceed without knowing for certain how the gaps in the tax law will be filled by tax policy makers, tax administrators, and (if it comes to that) judges.

The income after redistribution shows the net average coin per agent at the end of the episode (top right). The lower-skilled agents have higher net income under the AI Economist than under the other models. The Impact of Tax on Economic Activity. To form a better understanding of how taxes set by the AI Economist improve over those set by the Saez formula, which provides the strongest baseline, we compare their respective impacts on the agents' economic activity (Figure ). In both cases, the low-income agents choose to specialize as \"gatherer-and-seller\" agents. Interestingly, these agents collect fewer resources under the Saez policy, and the high-skilled \"buyer-and-builder\" agent compensates by increasing its own resource collection (Left panel). This de-specialization contributes to the decreased income generated through building under the Saez taxes (Middle panel), with this decrease accounting for weaker productivity. Because the Saez formula leads to a more regressive tax structure than the AI Economist, the latter yields higher equality through mechanical effects (i.e. stronger redistribution). Interestingly, the AI Economist also improves equality through behavioral effects. Under the Saez scheme, the \"buyer-and-builder\" collects more resources directly from the environment, meaning it makes fewer purchases from the other agents. Trading serves to redistribute the income achieved from building houses to the \"gatherer-and-seller\" agents, but, owing to the behavioral differences, this redistributive effect is stronger under the AI Economist (Right panel).

More stringent US state policy (e.g., closing down businesses more) may temper the spread of the pandemic (7,8), but may lead to lower productivity owing to higher unemployment. As a modeling assumption, the policy objective of US states depends on the level of federal subsidies: higher federal subsidies may incentivize US states to accept higher unemployment and be more stringent to reduce deaths. However, this may incur a higher national cost, e.g., through borrowing money. Hence, this presents a hard two-level optimization problem. Although the underlying public health and economic mechanics are complex, these correlations and trade-offs are salient in real data. We find that log-linear RL policies achieve significantly higher social welfare than baseline policies executed in simulation. These policies perform well across a wide range of relative weightings of public health and the economy, and demonstrate how the social planner can align US state incentives with national social welfare through subsidies. The policies are explainable: well-performing policies respond strongly to changes in recovery and vaccination rates, for example. Moreover, these results are robust to a range of calibration errors, e.g., infection rates that are over or underestimated. Our work is descriptive, not normative.

Results: From lowest to highest income quartile, mean age and proportion of White race increased; proportion of females, Black, and Hispanic race decreased (Table 1).

PREVIOUS STUDY The term \"tax incentives\" refers to special tax provisions intended to encourage certain behaviors or activities regarded as advantageous to the economy or society (Halimatussadiah et al., 2023).These incentives may take the form of tax credits, deductions, exemptions, or deferrals, among others.Governments frequently use them to encourage investment, create employment, promote research and development, or support particular industries or regions (Appiah-Kubi et al., 2021). Akanbi (2020) defines tax incentives as a deliberate reduction of the tax debt provided by the government to encourage certain economic units to act in a desired way.Barry (2002) say that tax incentives are a form of tax facility provided by the government to certain taxpayers in the form of reducing tax rates with the aim of minimizing the amount of the tax burden to be paid.Tax incentives are tax reductions or exemptions provided by the government to encourage investment, economic growth, job creation, and so on.Tax incentives are often used as a fiscal policy instrument to encourage economic growth and",

Since it cannot be excluded that a transition to a low-carbon economy will involve fundamental changes in lifestyles and culture, it is pertinent to study the impact of a combination of climate policy and changing social norms on lifestyles. While ABMs are capable of studying changes in norms, lifestyle and culture, which has received some attention in other areas (Bianchi & Squazzoni, 2015;Jackson, Rand, & Lewis, 2017), the reviewed ABM studies of climate policy lack attention for this.

Generally, ABMs can be used to examine if and how lifestyles change under certain policy mixes.

The agents optimize their individual post-tax utility by deciding how to perform labor and earn income. Both the planner and agents use RL to co-adapt and optimize their behavior.

Through a complete mapping of the optimal taxation research field, the work adds value to research practice and tax theory. The development patterns of the optimal taxation research field are described by discovering research productivity trends and the most productive countries in tax optimization. The identification of leading contributors identifies possible collaborators (universities and academics) for further tax optimization research. Finding the most appealing source titles reveals potential for publication. Leading thematic areas and developing subjects are identified, providing directions for scholars and identifying research gaps to be investigated. Limitations and Future Research Directions Although the bibliometric analysis and visualization on optimal taxation-related papers offered some interesting results, this work has several limitations. We made every effort to execute the bibliometric analysis in the most accurate manner possible, but quantitative research, without a doubt, cannot replace qualitative research. However, computational, quantitative analysis of the literature reduces the influence of subjective judgments associated with manual, qualitative analysis of the literature. As a result, we believe that combining the two approaches will increase the levels of achievement. More research is required to learn about the various thematic clusters and research",

The style of LPO and its rate of evolution depend on the effects of physiochemical conditions on the microphysics of deformation and recovery. Here, we integrate results from laboratory experiments and naturally deformed shear zones to evaluate how variability in the evolution of olivine LPO modifies existing strategies for interpreting seismic anisotropy. We concentrate on two particular effects. First, we show that olivine A\u2010 and E\u2010type LPOs evolve with opposite senses of rotation, producing a wide spectrum of angular relationships between the orientation of fast seismic wave propagation and the direction of flow. Second, we show that the presence of a pre\u2010existing LPO introduces a lag between changes in deformation kinematics and alignment of the seismic fast direction with the shear direction. The combination of these two factors affects the inference of deformation kinematics from seismic anisotropy and the interpretation of shear wave splitting parameters.",

A future challenge is to address climate policy issues in HANK models with systemic as well as idiosyncratic risks of climate change. This is still on the frontier of macroeconomic research, so here I adapt the more traditional partial equilibrium public finance perspective. A key idea is to rebate revenue of carbon taxation via lump-sum payments or \"climate dividends\" to all citizens to lower the cost of higher energy prices and thus lower the cost of living. Such \"tax-and-distribute\" policies aim to maximise fairness and political viability, since cash transfers benefit the poor disproportionally and help to make carbon taxes politically acceptable. Handing money directly back to citizens has the benefit of a visible and transparent increase in income for all. This especially benefits lower income groups compared to if the revenue is used to lower government debt or increase most types of public spending. Empirical studies suggest that most households benefit from \"carbon-tax-cum-dividend\" or CTCD policies. For the United States 70% of households benefit (Horowitz et al., 2017) and for Germany this figure is 67% (Edenhofer et al., 2019). This double dividend of green taxes and lower income inequality suggests that a CTCD policy is attractive politically.

In particular, even though the \"Camelback\" tax schedule is qualitatively different than the tax schedule that results from the Saez framework, it yields a competitive equality-productivity tradeoff in comparison with the schedule coming from the Saez model. .

Nevertheless, in terms of absolute tax payments, higher incomes will bear a larger burden. Why does optimal progressivity fall in response to higher revenue requirements? We show that considering Laffer bounds on marginal tax rates helps to understand the implications of fiscal pressure. We find that the additional leeway governments have for rising marginal tax rates is significantly higher for low incomes: the difference between Laffer bounds for marginal tax rates and actual marginal tax rates is highest for low incomes. Our simulations for different European countries show that the change in optimal tax progressivity depends on country-specific properties of the tax-transfer system, though it is quantitatively significant for all countries. Importantly, we do not rely on a particular social welfare function that may imply different preferences for redistribution than those of current governments. Instead, we use an inverse-optimum approach (Bourguignon and Spadaro, 2012). We calibrate the Pareto weights for which the pre-pandemic tax-transfer systems are optimal. Then we ask how the optimal progressivity of the tax-transfer system should change due to COVID-19 induced fiscal pressure given these welfare weights. We start the paper with a refresher about optimal nonlinear income taxation. First, we consider a simple benchmark without income effects and exogenous marginal social welfare weights.

Using 2005 DHS and 2011 DHS to compare education attainment for different age groups (in working age), we find that the young men and women were the most benefited from the rise in education levels. For instance, the share of females from 15 to 19 years of age with some secondary education jumped from 18 percent to 35 percent (while for males in the same age group it changed from 24 to 43 percent).

A common measure of the redistributive effects of the PIT is the Musgrave-Thin index, which is calculated as the difference between the Gini coefficients of, respectively, before and after-tax income. This index can be decomposed into its progressivity and size components, reflecting the fact that the redistributive impact of taxation depends not only on how tax rates rise with income (progressivity), but also on total collected taxes as a proportion of aggregate income, referred to as the aggregate tax rate (see Box 2). Box 2. Measures of Progressivity and Redistribution As first introduced by Pigou (1928), progressivity has been traditionally measured, for a given level of taxable income, as the ratio of the change in the average tax rate to the change in taxable income. However, this simple measure does not reflect how progressivity varies across the income distribution. The measure used by Peter, Buttrick, and Duncan (2010) captures progressivity over the full distribution by calculating the average tax rate progression over 100 data points in the before-tax income distribution (estimated as the slope of a regression of the average tax rate on income). Another approach, developed notably by",

IV (2SLS) regressions are used to address endogeneity of the respective tax shares (i.e., PIT_share, VAT_share, TradeTaxes_share and their interacted terms), which are instrumented with their first lags. IV. How Progressive are PIT systems? Market income tends to be distributed unequally. Tax policy can contribute to address this inequality, including through a progressive PIT design. Progressive taxes have an explicit redistributive effect as the after-tax income distribution is made less unequal than the before-tax income distribution. Inequality remains a pressing issue in LIDCs While global inequality has declined markedly over the last 40 years as a result of GDP per capita convergence among countries, within-country income inequality remains a key issue in LIDCs and emerging marketsincluding in the fast-growing economies that have contributed the most to global convergence (World Bank 2016). Figure 11 shows the Gini coefficient of disposable income for the 1980-1990 period and for the latest available year. It shows that that despite the reduction in within-country disposable income 21 inequality in some developing economies (those below the line, for instance Mauritania and Sierra Leone), the opposite trend occurred in other LIDCs (those above the line, for instance Rwanda and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire). On average, income inequality in LIDCs and EMEs (blue triangles and red squares in the figure) remains significantly higher than it is in AEs (green dots). Moreover, the effects of the COVID-19 health pandemic have had unequal effects across and within countries, potentially exacerbating inequalities (IMF 2021b),",

I calibrate the model to match moments of disability risk, earnings risk, employment decisions, and wealth holdings in the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) during the early 1990s.The model replicates well-relevant nontargeted features in the data.In particular, at any point in the life cycle, a substantial fraction of households have few financial assets, leaving these households vulnerable to predictable and unpredictable income declines.Moreover, low financial assets, coupled with substantial wealth in the form of consumer durables, are concentrated at low-income households and are prevalent even close to retirement.For example, the median household aged 50-64 who left the labor force holds less than $2000 in financial assets.At the same time, the median durable consumption stock among these households is $30,000.Besides many households holding almost no financial assets, the model is consistent with small nondurable consumption changes when households enter nonemployment",

In this scenario, U.S. production, and labor demand increase, raising workers' wages. We find a positive effect of the policy on real income (+0.33%) and a slight negative impact on welfare (-0.02%), driven by the loss of tax revenues. This former effect can be decomposed between the effect of a significant positive response of wages (increasing welfare by +0.39%) that is not offset by the negative response of tax revenues (decreasing welfare by 0.08%).

I show in a simple model that this distinction is driven by the lifetime of generations: the longer people live, the less potent the estate tax compared to a wealth tax. 5 Gabaix et al. (2016) primarily focus on income inequality, but their formal findings apply to wealth as well. 6 This solution differs from the solutions proposed by Gabaix et al.

The results largely show that taxpayers avoid higher rates by keeping their reported income low-a response that is, at least partly, linked to evasion. Laboratory experiments largely confirm the negative relationship between the tax rate and reported income. A laboratory setting, where it is possible to vary the tax rate and measure evasion precisely, reported that income decreases when the tax rate increases (Alm, 2012;Torgler, 2002). Much of the compliance literature has focused on domestic taxes-for the most part, income taxes. However, the same question on tax rates and evasion has been central to the trade liberalisation debate too. While trade liberalisation refers to a broader set of issues, the reduction of tariff rates is a central element to it. A strand of the trade liberalisation literature has therefore investigated the revenue effects of such tariff reductions. The immediate mechanical effect of a decrease",

Importantly, trade liberalisation is indeed meant to stimulate more trade flows. Such an increase in trade volume may compensate, at least partly, for the revenue loss from lower tariffs. At the same time, much like in the domestic tax compliance literature, decreases in the rate of trade taxes may reduce evasion at the border. Estimating this relationship is particularly important in low-income countries (LICs), which face great pressure to liberalise trade while struggling to raise the necessary revenue to fund basic public spending. As a share of their economy, LICs typically raise lower tax than their higher-income counterparts and face higher evasion (Besley & Persson, 2014). The literature so far has shown that LICs have found it particularly hard to recoup lost revenue from trade liberalisation, compared with their higher-income counterparts (Baunsgaard & Keen, 2010;Cage & Gadenne, 2018). This paper contributes to these strands of literature and debates by providing new evidence on the relationship between the tax rate and trade tax evasion in an LIC: Ethiopia. We measure tax evasion as the trade gap. By comparing records of traded goods on the exporter and importer sides, we can identify the trade gap as the quantity or value of traded goods that appear to be exported from the trading partner but do not appear to have been received by the importing country (see Section 4 for more details).

A laboratory setting, where it is possible to vary the tax rate and measure evasion precisely, reported that income decreases when the tax rate increases (Alm, 2012;Torgler, 2002). Much of the compliance literature has focused on domestic taxes-for the most part, income taxes. However, the same question on tax rates and evasion has been central to the trade liberalisation debate too. While trade liberalisation refers to a broader set of issues, the reduction of tariff rates is a central element to it. A strand of the trade liberalisation literature has therefore investigated the revenue effects of such tariff reductions. The immediate mechanical effect of a decrease",

However, in the other two problems, if incentives do not pass a threshold (1 + to overcome the environment penalty in Escape Room; a more complex opportunity cost for sacrificing self-interest in Cleanup), then the agents do not receive any predefined environment rewards, which means an RL-based designer does not receive any feedback at all. In this case, MetaGrad's knowledge of the way that agents' policy parameters change in response to the incentive function, and the use of online cross-validation to learn from the ID's returns in subsequent episodes, is crucial. CONCLUSION We proposed the use of complex simulations involving reinforcement learning agents as an in silico experimental approach to problems of incentive design. To tackle the issue of delayed impact of incentives, which poses difficulties for directly applying standard RL to the incentive designer, we proposed a meta-gradient approach for the incentive designer to account exactly for the agents' learning response to incentives. The new method significantly outperforms baselines on benchmark problems and also improves the trade-off between productivity and equality in a complex simulated economy. Beyond incentive design, one may consider the extension of ideas in this work to the context of mechanism design, interpreted in the general sense of modifying the underlying dynamics of the environment [22] to shape agents' behavior and optimize a system-level objective.

This study shows that, even in the absence of asymmetric excess profit distribution, the optimal variable profit tax rate increases due to the enlarged profit tax base, when it is set simultaneously with the optimal income taxes. This paper is also related to Scheuer (2014), who studies optimal profit and labor income taxation by explicitly modeling entrepreneurship via a two-dimensional skill distribution.

Finally, Atesagaoglu and Yazici (2020) investigate the implications of exogenously increasing markups (and declining labor share) for optimal linear capital and labor income taxation. In their setting, the government does not have redistributive concerns and aims at financing an exogenous stream of expenditure.

Having reduced the dynamic of wealth to this simple model, I apply the Kolmogorov (1931) forward equation, a standard result of stochastic calculus, which is known to be extremely useful in understanding how wealth distributions get their power-law shape (Gabaix, 2009). This equation relates how wealth evolves stochastically at the individual level with how the distribution of wealth evolves deterministically in the aggregate. Traditionally, this equation is used deductively: starting from a set of parameters for how individual wealth evolves, we apply it to determine how the distribution changes. This paper argues that it is possible to use that equation inductively. That is, looking at how the distribution changes, we can infer the parameters (the mean and the variance of savings) that govern the underlying individual wealth accumulation process. That we can infer the individual wealth accumulation process -including a mobility parameter -from cross-sectional data may prima facie be counterintuitive. This paper provides a simple explanation for that fact. Basically, mobility is a force that spreads out observations and, therefore, flattens the wealth density locally. Consequently, the changes it exerts on the distribution depend on how flat it is to begin with. In contrast, the local effect exerted by the drift (i.e., how much wealth grows at a given point on average) is akin to a local translation (Piketty and Saez, 2013a;Saez and Stantcheva, 2018). and is independent of the",

In contrast to the DS formula, the Badel-Huggett formula applies to models with several sources of government revenue besides earnings (e.g., taxes on capital or consumption) and to models featuring certain anticipatory responses (e.g., changes in human capital accumulation or savings that occur in anticipation of higher future tax rates).

All studies agree that welfare and distributional implications significantly depend on how CO 2 tax revenue is recycled. However, no consensus has been established regarding the progressivity or regressivity of the tax itself. For example, several studies, including Mathur and Morris (2014), indicate that a CO 2 tax (absent any impacts from revenue recycling) is regressive, while others, such as Rausch et al. (2010) and Cronin et al. (2017) find it to be progressive. All agree, however, that the tax's distributional impacts ultimately depend as much or more on how the CO 2 tax revenue is recycled than the direct effect of abatement costs.

In these models, people accumulate wealth for precautionary or consumption smoothing purposes. But these motives quickly vanish as wealth increases, so they cannot rationalize large wealth holdings. As a result, these models notoriously underestimate the real extent of wealth inequality. The literature, then, has searched for ways to extend these models and match the data. One possibility involves additional saving motives for the rich, such as a taste for wealth (Carroll, 1998) or bequests (De Nardi, 2004). Another solution is to introduce idiosyncratic stochastic rates of returns in the form of entrepreneurial risk (Quadrini, 2000;Cagetti and De Nardi, 2006;Benhabib, Bisin, and Zhu, 2011). Yet another option introduces heterogeneous shocks to the discount rate (Krusell and Smith, 1998). Recent contributions have zoomed in on specific features and issues. Following the finding from Bach, Calvet, and Sodini (2020) (in Sweden) and Fagereng et al. (2020) (in Norway) that the wealthy enjoy higher returns, several papers have examined this mechanism in the United States. Xavier (2021) finds that heterogeneous returns play a critical role in explaining the current levels of wealth inequality. Cioffi (2021) embeds a portfolio choice model in a wealth accumulation model. In this paper, because of heterogeneous portfolio composition, households have different exposures to aggregate risks. The wealthy invest more in high-risk, high-return assets like equity. As a result, Cioffi (2021) finds that abnormally high stock market returns have been a critical driver of the rise",

The use of revenue can also have important distributional implications, as discussed in Macaluso et al. (this issue). Future research can build on this work in several ways. First, as discussed in Barron et al. (this issue), the current version of the models involved in this study is not optimized for investigating deep decarbonization scenarios. In particular, they do not include the detailed treatment of the transportation sector to project deployment of technologies such as electric vehicles and low carbon biofuels that are essential to significant decarbonization of the sector. Secondly, the recent tax legislation in the United States substantially changes the statutory corporate tax rate and other revenue variables. This changes both baseline tax parameters and baseline debt projections, and this could change the efficiency gains from the tax swap scenarios. A useful extension would be to account for the new baseline and extend the scenarios to other options for revenue use, such as debt reduction and new spending, such as on infrastructure, research and development, or social safety net",

This paper is a technical overview of the scenario design and the results for the effects of the four core policies. We compare various outcomes across the models, such as emissions, revenue, macroeconomic outcomes, sectoral impacts, and welfare. Given the intent of this study, the most important conclusions of this study are for policy design. We refer the reader to Barron et al.

That paper enumerates the important robust takeaways as well as the caveats for this modeling project and other exercises like it. It also documents results not featured here, such as for scenarios in which modelers solve for the carbon tax paths that achieve particular emissions goals and the ways in which the carbon tax scenarios reduce conventional air pollutants. For more discussion of distributional outcomes of the policies, we refer the reader to Caron et al. (this issue). Macaluso et al. (this issue) review the sectoral and trade outcomes. In short, the results here are consistent with much of the existing modeling literature on carbon pricing in the United States.

A common method for resolving these tradeoffs posits a set of social welfare weights, \u03c7 (y), for each level of income y (e.g. Saez and Stantcheva (2016)). For example, these weights may be decreasing in income so that they capture a preference for equity. This approach would then ask whether the weighted average of surplus is positive, E [s (y) \u03c7 (y)] > 0. However, the downside of this approach is that it generates conclusions that depend on the social welfare weights. Because these weights reflect ethical and philosophical tradeoffs about which there is no consensus, this approach can fail to generate universal agreement about whether the alternative environment should be preferred to the status quo. Eight decades ago, Kaldor (1939) and Hicks (1940) proposed a method to resolve this problem. Instead of appealing to set of social welfare weights, they proposed modifying the environments with transfers. They show that an appropriate set of transfers removes the need for interpersonal comparisons in the first place; instead they rely only on the Pareto principle. Kaldor (1939) noted that when E [s (y)] > 0 one could construct a modified alternative environment that includes compensating transfers so that the winners compensate the losers. This modified alternative can be preferred to the status quo without requiring a particular set of social welfare weights -everyone would be better off. Analogously, when E [s (y)] < 0, Hicks (1940) noted that one could construct a modified status quo environment in which",

I develop a model of optimal taxation for a federal system of governments in the tradition of Mirrlees (1971), where taxes can be fully nonlinear but informational asymmetries prevent the equalization of well being across workers due to informational rents. Here, I extend the large literature on federalism and tax competition by obtaining optimal tax formulas for the federal and state governments. The literature has mainly focused on inefficiencies that arise due to fiscal externalities when governments have access to restricted instruments, that is, linear taxes. Contrary to previous results, I show here that state governments will provide redistribution through income taxes and that, in a symmetric equilibrium, the overall tax schedule that combines the actions of both the federal and state governments is the same as that of a unitary government. This finding implies that, under the conditions analyzed in this problem, there is no reason to restrict income redistribution objectives to the federal government. This article is closely related to Gordon and Cullen (2012). I extend their results in three important ways. First, I model explicitly the migration of workers as an extensive-margin decision.

Simple mathematical manipulations are used to create income indicators, which are then combined with other economic and demographic variables to create a wide range of possibilities for measuring the tax system. Making choices to measure the fiscal optimum is an iterative process that involves testing certain hypotheses or possible reformulations of some central concepts. Revenue collection indicators are constructed as ratios of two variables. Explicit discussions on the measurement of tax revenues have led to better clarification of the concept and theoretical conclusions concerning the state's connection with society [8]. Economists' approaches to optimal taxation differ from those of social or non-social scientists, on the one hand, due to the attention paid to fiscal incentives and their effects, and on the other hand due to the awareness of the general balance [9]. There is a multitude of approaches to the optimal from a fiscal perspective, so concepts such as optimal tax, optimal tax rates, optimal tax revenues, optimal fiscal policy, optimal fiscal system, optimal fiscal administration, etc., can be discussed. Each individual can identify at least three reporting criteria in terms of \"optimality\" in tax matters. A first approach argues that an optimal tax system ensures that costs are kept to a minimum. A second approach argues that an optimal tax system is a system of fairness, equity, and impartiality. The third approach focuses on the fact that tax systems can be classified according to economic efficiency criteria, which is also the starting point for the optimal taxation theory.

(2016) and Adrian and Duarte (2016) call \"vulnerable growth\", i.e., highly left-skewed distribution of GDP growth correlated with financial leverage. Our contribution is to generate such vulnerable growth in a completely structural way. The nature of asymmetric distributions in our framework is comparable to Dupraz et al. (2017), who generate an asymmetric distribution of the unemployment rate by combining downward nominal wage rigidity and search frictions but abstract from income inequality and financial crises. Relatedly, Kocherlakota (2000) and Jensen et al. (2017) show that occasionally binding financial constraints in a highly leveraged economy can be an important source of business cycle asymmetries. While our paper also highlights the role of credit in generating asymmetric distributions, Kocherlakota (2000) and Jensen et al.

Importantly, to the best of our knowledge, the interaction between financial crises and the binding ZLB constraint in our paper is only found in Guerrieri and Lorenzoni (2017).

The main contribution of the article is our characterization of the optimal tax scheme in this dynamic extensive labor supply environment. Indeed, the optimal tax can be described as the result of a balance between two forces: a redistributive force, holding labor supply constant, and an efficiency force, which comes from changes in labor supply and production. This generalizes the first-order conditions from Laroque (2011).

Together, these proposals offer more efficient and equitable sources of revenue than court debt. When reformulating their tax systems, states and municipalities should consider racial equity. Given the racial disparities of the current tax system, policymakers should prioritize policies aimed at building minority wealth and ending subsidies to the white and wealthy (Brown 2021;Steverman 2021). Eliminating many of the barriers to taxation discussed earlier can promote both economic stability and racial justice. Many barriers to taxation, such as supermajority requirements for tax increases and property tax limits, originated during the Jim Crow and Reconstruction Eras, respectively (Leachman et al. 2018.

Such an approach acknowledges and rejects the legacy of white supremacy. In so doing, it enables states and municipalities to pursue policies that further substantive equality, and with it, social justice. With respect to positive reforms, revitalizing property taxes is particularly promising (Hayashi and Kleiman 2020). But to formulate an efficient and equitable property tax, lawmakers must consider that residences in African American and Latino neighborhoods are consistently over-assessed, while residences in majority white neighborhoods are persistently under-assessed (Harris 2004, 2;Atuahene 2020, 111, 124, 179). This means that residents of minority neighborhoods likely bear a disproportionate tax burden for public goods funded by property taxes (Harris 2004, 2). Such a trend typifies the extractive and redistributive logics of both tax and court debt discussed earlier. To avoid replicating such harmful practices, governments can use assessments based on the actual cash costs (i.e., the purchase prices) of residential parcels of property, rather than market-based assessments (ibid., 5). These are just a small sample of potential policy responses. Other promising initiatives also deserve serious consideration (see, for example, Hanauer 2020).

In the left panel of of Figure 12 we repeat the tax analysis for the manual tax skill wedge. Finally, in Appendix B we analyze robustness of our results with respect to firm heterogeneity. Conclusion We advance the understanding of optimal taxation policy in multidimensional environments with bunching theoretically as well as quantitatively. Our general ABC formula shares the logic of the classic ABC formula but instead shows that at the optimum the schedule of tax benefits should second order stochastically dominate the schedule of tax distortions.

Suppose a solution \u03b3 is not symmetric, and use that the worker input samples are identical to define another feasible transport plan\u03b3 so that\u03b3 ijk = \u03b3 jik for all workers and projects. When \u03b3 solves the assignment problem, so does\u03b3 because where the second equality follows as the production technology is symmetric in worker inputs, and the third equality follows by relabeling. This implies that the assignment 1 2 (\u03b3 +\u03b3) is also a solution, which is indeed a symmetric solution. In summary, for every optimal assignment \u03b3 there is a symmetric assignment 1 2 (\u03b3 +\u03b3) that also solves the assignment problem. Without loss of generality we can therefore focus on assignments \u03b3 that are symmetric in worker inputs. Second, we prove it is optimal to self-match workers so that \u03b3 ijk = 0 implies that the workers are identical, or i = j. Consider an optimal symmetric assignment \u03b3 and some project z k , and denote the joint distribution of workers assigned to this project by \u03b3 k ij := \u03b3 ijk .

The cashiers are in the blunt bunching region. They are bunched in both the manual and the cognitive dimensions and this leads to their allocation being heavily distorted compared to the benchmark. In the left panel of of Figure 12 we repeat the tax analysis for the manual tax skill wedge. Finally, in Appendix B we analyze robustness of our results with respect to firm heterogeneity. Conclusion We advance the understanding of optimal taxation policy in multidimensional environments with bunching theoretically as well as quantitatively. Our general ABC formula shares the logic of the classic ABC formula but instead shows that at the optimum the schedule of tax benefits should second order stochastically dominate the schedule of tax distortions. For an empirically relevant model, we show that bunching is both substantial and nuanced and, hence, importantly impacts the design of optimal policy.

The intuition for the tax smoothing results is that, with heterogeneous workers and a lump-sum tax component, it is distributional concerns that determine the desired level of distortive taxation.At any point in time, the current tax rate is a measure of redistribution across workers, while the distribution of relative skills determines the desired level of redistribution.In the model, this level is constant over time and invariant to government expenditure and technology shocks because these shocks do not directly affect the distribution of relative skills across workers.

Societies may have their own good reasons for avoiding complete reliance on lump-sum taxation and resigning themselves to the use of distortionary taxes.Unfortunately, none of these reasons are explicitly captured by a representative-agent Ramsey framework.Although the first-best allocation is ruled out, an arbitrary second-best problem is set in its place.What confidence can we have that tax recommendations obtained this way accurately evaluate the trade-offs faced by society?If, for reasons unspecified by the model, lump-sum taxes are presumably undesirable for society yet still desirable within the model, how can we be sure that the tax prescriptions derived are not, for the same unspecified reasons, also socially undesirable? Distributional concerns are a natural reason to resort to distortionary taxation (Mirrlees, 1971).If workers are heterogeneous with respect to their labor productivity, and if this trait is not observable, or if for some reason taxes cannot be conditioned upon them, then society cannot attain almost any of the first-best allocations.In contrast, by taxing observable differences such as income, redistribution is possible, albeit at a loss in efficiency.Such a trade-off between redistribution and efficiency provides a microfoundation for the role of",

The central objective of optimal taxation is not to maximize the national income, but to maximize the social welfare of the country because a decrease in population income is accompanied by a reduction in tax collections.

They investigated the question presented by Ljungqvist and Uhlig and discovered that there is no evident link between the state-varying tax and the intertemporally dependent preference. The alluvial diagram of optimal taxation field was created by using a web application available at https://www.mapequation.org/alluvial/ (accessed on 31 August 2021). We first used CiteSpace to convert the literature by the co-citation network, then uploaded the annual network information files one by one into the Alluvial Generator. We obtained the diagram shown in Figure 15 after screening the data and refining the layout. We used four categories of networks (keywords, authors, cited documents, and cited authors) to identify structural changes between clusters. The networks are shown as vertical stacks connected by streamlines. In each stack, nodes that are clustered together form a module, drawn as a rectangle. The height of the streamline is proportional to the aggregated flow in the nodes that are present in the connected modules. Module size is based on the flow, and modules are sorted by the flow. Of all the flows, 99.60% are visible. Network names and modules names are labeled. If we consider the first module, we can see that it contains 331 nodes, and the",

Most people think that tax revenues disproportionately fund central government revenues. Taxpayers then receive different treatments. One group is given information that regional governments indeed have the power to change marginal tax rates and that tax revenue is evenly split between regional and central governments. Another treatment shows individuals how much taxes they should have paid for an additional hundred Euros earned. After the treatment, individuals are then asked about various reform options. After receiving the correct information about their marginal tax rates, individuals are more likely to support more progressive tax reforms. Such a result suggests that people's pre-treatment views on progressivity are influenced by their personal beliefs that their own marginal tax rates are too high. Moreover, individuals that received information on the distribution of tax revenues between the regional and central government are more likely to regard inequality as a problem. This latter view represents an important contribution in a multicultural (and multi-tiered) country with strong regional identities, such as Spain. It suggests that people are more inclined to view inequality as a problem, when they know that the tax revenue funds services for individuals similar to them (i.e. in the same region).

Optimal Tax and Transfer System The optimal system is substantially more redistributive than the system currently in place in the United States. Optimal transfers are large at $19,800 in 2012 US dollars for the lowest-income household. This value implies an income floor of 23% of mean income (m 5 0:23).

Optimal income tax progressivity is moderate at v 5 0:14, only slightly higher than in the status quo. Optimal average t&T rates are more progressive than marginal rates, as figure 7 shows. Average rates monotonically increase with income because of both transfers and progressive labor taxes. Marginal rates, however, are not monotonic.

Since the IRS does not conduct audits on a rolling basis, the rewards are delayed and updated all at once.

Despite the updated bivalent boosters representing a significant step forward in prevention strategy, less than 4% of eligible Americans had taken the booster in the first month after it became available (Bendix, 2022;Lambert, 2022). As such, and with an enduring history of inequities in health care access in the US (Bailey et al., 2021;Blendon et al., 2002;Carpenter, 2021;Chrisler et al., 2016;Feldman et al., 2021;Okonkwo et al., 2021;Ortega & Roby, 2021;Rapp et al., 2022;Whitehead et al., 2016), it is clear that without further intervention not all communities will be equally able to benefit from the updated vaccines and inequities in COVID-19 illness and mortality may persist despite the technological innovations in vaccine technology.

For each division, the median trendline and quantile ranges are shown weighted by county population size. Prior literature has demonstrated that the spread and impact of COVID-19 has varied geography over time reflecting dynamics in the timing of introduction and transmission events. Methods employed to highlight the geographic patterning in COVID-19 outcomes have included quantile regression (Sigler et al., 2021), Besag-York-Molli e mixed models (Whittle & Diaz-Artiles, 2020), spatial cluster analysis (Sugg et al., 2021), geographically weighted regression (Mollalo et al., 2020;Park et al., 2021), and others.

One of the critical variables to be controlled is real estate economic rent. The second scenario evaluated the role of the media in decreasing real estate economic rent. It revealed that empowering the media's role in clarification leads to the reduction of tax evasion and real estate economic rent. Transparency contributed to the use of on-time registration mechanisms in legal books and documentations, awareness of taxpayers about representable documents to tax affairs administration, awareness of taxpayers about the consequent fines resulting from not delivering sufficient documents on-time, awareness of taxable businesses active in rental properties from the way registration for or installation of point of sale must be done, decreased involuntary tax evasion and finally decreased real estate economic rent. The third scenario, despite public perception, emphasized the tax rate decrease. This scenario showed that the tax rate decreased by increasing real estate transfer significantly. In turn, it resulted in increased income from real estate transfer and the amount of paid tax. Also, the tax rate decrease contributed to increased self-declaration by taxpayers active in the real estate domain, which finally would lead to increased collected tax. The study's findings conducted by Alijanzadeh (2002) approved the decreased tax rate's role in increasing tax incomes.

    "final_passages": "[0] a scalable and sequential instructional scaffolding suitable for multiple levels of students that was inspired by common income tax return forms. Tax codes are incredibly complex and may be daunting to the nonexpert. For example, the U.S. Tax Code (Title 26) is over 2,600 pages in length, but the Internal Revenue Service Form 1040 greatly simplifies this into a few pages that the average person can easily navigate to correctly pay their income tax. Similarly, common evolution equations, including the Hardy-Weinberg principle and its extensions that include natural selection and mutation, are often abstract and nonintuitive for students due to the combination of italicized letters and multiple orders of operations. This disconnect from everyday concepts is a persistent obstacle to understanding evolution (Hanisch & Eirdosh, 2020). Just as Form 1040, with its associated tax table and income adjustment schedules, seeks to simplify calculations into a series of fillable lines, our objective was to design similar forms that deconstruct evolution equations into discrete boxes that students fill in to guide them through the process. This technique reduces the prevalence of common errors, including missteps in the order of operations. c Evolution Equations The most common series of equations that students encounter while learning about genetic evolution is the Hardy-Weinberg principle. This concept serves as the null hypothesis that a population in equilibrium is not evolving. For the population to be in equilibrium, it must not experience any of the following conditions: mutation, selection, genetic drift, gene flow, or nonrandom mating. Any deviation from these conditions pushes the\n[1] \"on household net wealth above $50 million and at a 2 percent rate and above $1 billion at a 3 percent rate per year\" (York 2021). Finally, states can adapt Dorothy Brown's proposal for federal income tax reform by \"[eliminating exclusions, reducing deductions, and returning to a single progressive tax system\" in their state tax codes (Brown 2021, 206). Together, these proposals offer more efficient and equitable sources of revenue than court debt. When reformulating their tax systems, states and municipalities should consider racial equity. Given the racial disparities of the current tax system, policymakers should prioritize policies aimed at building minority wealth and ending subsidies to the white and wealthy (Brown 2021;Steverman 2021). Eliminating many of the barriers to taxation discussed earlier can promote both economic stability and racial justice. Many barriers to taxation, such as supermajority requirements for tax increases and property tax limits, originated during the Jim Crow and Reconstruction Eras, respectively (Leachman et al. 2018. Similarly, Mississippi introduced the first modern American sales tax in 1932 to produce \"a reduction in taxes owed by mostly white property owners and an increase in those owed by Black households that owned little or no property and had little else to tax\" (ibid., 2). Conversely, elimination of such barriers can serve as a repudiation of the racist motivations underpinning their initial enactment. Such reforms can include \"[eliminating supermajority requirements to raise revenues\" [repeal [ing or reform[ing rigid, formulaic property tax limits,\" \"[eliminating other constitutional restrictions on raising revenue,\" and \"[strengthening state 'rainy day funds,'\" by\n[2] findings regarding the linkage between income inequality, aggregate demand, and financial stability. Section 7 analyzes the relationship between monetary policy and the macroeconomy using alternative monetary policy rules. Section 8 concludes. A complete description of the non-stochastic steady state, the solution method, the complete system of equations and additional results are described in Appendix A, B, C, and D, respectively. Related Literature Our paper contributes to three strands of literature. First, it contributes to the theoretical literature that formalizes the link between income inequality and aggregate demand. Auclert and Rognlie (2016), Kaplan et al. (2018) and McKay and Reis (2016) construct models that feature rich heterogeneity a la Bewley-Huggett-Aiyagari and nominal rigidities. Auclert and Rognlie (2016) show that a permanent increase in income inequality can lead to a permanent Keynesian recession. Kaplan et al. (2018) show that monetary policy transmission channel can be fundamentally different for the rich and the poor. In turn, McKay and Reis (2016) and Mitman et al. (2017) analyze the large stabilization role of fiscal and social insurance policies in an economy suffering from insufficient aggregate demand due to income inequality. While our modeling of income inequality is much more stylized compared with this literature, our stylized model allow us to study the link among income inequality and financial vulnerability in the sense of endogenous financial crises and the policy dilemma facing a monetary authority trying to secure price stability and financial stability under the ZLB constraint, which are absent in this literature. Finally, none of this literature exploits the bargaining power\n[3] (2020) study optimal mitigation policies in a model with three types of agents: retirees, young workers in the essential sector, and young workers in the nonessential sector. Relative to their work, my paper features heterogeneity across not only age, but also income and wealth, and complements Glover et al. (2020) by analyzing mitigation policies specifically targeting the heterogeneous behavior of these subgroups. Kaplan et al. (2020) do not model heterogeneity by age, but include heterogeneity across income, wealth, sector, and occupation. Like my paper, they focus on policies that improve not only average outcomes but also account for the distributional consequences of mitigation policies. Relative to Kaplan et al. (2020), my paper addresses the externalities that are generated by the differential effects of COVID-19 by age. It also explicitly accounts for the value of life so that individual welfare changes directly reflect economic as well as expected health outcomes and proposes policies that can improve aggregate outcomes in a Pareto improving sense. Many papers have also questioned the tradeoff between economic and health outcomes as this paper does. For example, Acemoglu et al. (2021) and Fajgelbaum et al.

It starts by demonstrating the effects of simple tax policy changes to illustrate the model's key mechanisms. Then, it quantifies different scenarios of minimum taxation and discusses these policies' short-and long-term effects. Finally, it evaluates the introduction of a border-adjustment tax in the spirit of the DBCFT proposal. The findings are derived using calibrated parameters summarized in Table H1. We assess the external validity of the calibration in Figure H1, and we analyze the sensitivity of the results to different elasticities in the Supplemental Material (section E). To simulate counterfactual tax reforms, we follow the exact hat algebra methodology popularized by and Costinot and Rodriguez-Clare (2014), which consists in writing the new equilibrium in proportional changes w.r.t. the baseline one (see Appendix G for details). We mainly focus on the U.S. as an example throughout the discussion. Preliminaries: Model mechanism Unilateral tax reforms.

A notable exception is a recent paper by Findeisen and Sachs (2014). The authors calibrate a model combining optimal nonlinear income taxation in the tradition of Mirrlees (1971) with discrete schooling choice in the tradition of Roy (1951), Willis and Rosen (1979), Heckman et al. (2006), and others. Both the paper of Findeisen et al. and the present paper assess the efficiency of education policy but choose different modeling strategies. While Findeisen et al. follow Mirrlees (1971) andBovenberg et al. (2005) in allowing for individual heterogeneity, the present paper is grounded in Ramsey's tradition and studies the efficiency of educational incentives in the framework of a representative taxpayer. Both modeling strategies have advantages and disadvantages. The model of Findeisen et al. is rich enough to incorporate multidimensional heterogeneity, idiosyncratic risk, and borrowing constraints. The downside of this complexity is simplicity in modeling details. For example, individual preferences are assumed to be quasi linear. Furthermore, psychic costs, which are not well understood, are pivotal for explaining schooling choice. By contrast, the present paper does not explicitly rely on psychic costs and builds on arbitrary utility functions. This level of generality comes at the cost of neglecting heterogeneity. However, we argue that disregarding individual heterogeneity is rather appropriate when analyzing policy issues. After all, tax and education policy is not designed for individuals or small groups characterized by distinct social criteria. Tax and education policy must set efficient incentives for individuals at large. Although we cannot determine the efficiency frontier with our data, we\n[6] in turn, could generate greater personal and corporate income taxation revenue (Fjaerli & Aaberge, 2000;Stiglitz, 1987). As McGregor, Smith, and Wills (2019) acknowledge such a challenge, \"measuring inequality is not straightforward, as it requires decisions to be made on the variable, population, and distributional characteristics of interest\" (p. 368). As such, this article delves into the central question of whether inequality should be incorporated into tax policy and design. The structure of this paper is as follows: Section 2 reviews the relevant literature relating to tax policy and inequality; Section 3 provides the paper\"s research methodology; Section 4 observes the relevant findings; Section 5 presents the paper\"s discussion; and Section 6 concludes the article. LITERATURE REVIEW Within the literature, a working model assumption exists that the optimal tax theory is the policy standard by which to determine tax objectives (and as such, whether inequality should be a function of tax policy. Optimal tax theory, in short, addresses tax design from the rubric of maximizing \"social welfare,\" which is arguably a function of \"distributive justice\" and \"empirical evidence,\" such as behavioral and rational decision-making effects to incentives (and disincentives) (Mirrlees, 1971;Ramsey, 1927;Stiglitz, 1987). The optimal tax theory literature seeks to provide a more objective and systematic framework in evaluating the \"tradeoff\" between equity and (economic) efficiency 1 (Akerlof, 1978;Saez, 2001). The optimal tax theory is predicated on maximizing social welfare, which in turn, is 1 As a juxtaposition of tax and economics, the optimal tax theorists factor in the 'efficient markets hypothesis' espoused by the likes of\n[7] Jain-Chandra and others, 2018). Tax policies can also directly impact a household's and/or a woman's decision to enter the formal labor force (see for instance Grown and Valodia, 2010;LaLumia, 2017;IMF 2017e). This paper is also related to a growing macro literature that studies the impact of government policy on female labor force participation in a micro-founded framework featuring life-cycle dynamics and agents' heterogeneity, such as Chade and Ventura (2002) and Guner, Kaygusuz, and Ventura (2011). While this literature has focused in the United States and advanced economies, our paper is the first to focus on low income countries. In this respect, our work is related Peralta and others (2019), that studies the distributional impact of tax reforms in low income countries, though it does not distinguish males from females. \u00a9International Monetary Fund. Not for Redistribution III. BACKGROUND ON SENEGAL The share of female labor force in total labor force has been increasing over the past two decades at a faster pace in Senegal than in the rest of sub-Saharan Africa (Figure 1a). The growth was particularly notable between 2006 to 2011, when women's share in the total labor force participation rate jumped from 35 percent to 38 percent, and the female-to-male employment increased by 14 percentage points (Figure 1b). Despite this progress, female labor force participation in Senegal remains below sub-Saharan Africa's average. Gender gaps in primary education in both enrollment and completion rates have closed and even reversed in Senegal. According to UNESCO, primary education completion rates rose from 33 percent for girls and 43\n[8] trade-off that governs the theory of optimal labor income taxation (Piketty and Saez, 2013b) and, in practice, dominates policy considerations. In this framework, the elasticity of capital supply with respect to the net-of-tax rate directly dictates the optimal level of capital taxation. 4 But finding a way to model this elasticity in a realistic yet tractable way, without facing the same degeneracy issues as earlier models, remains difficult. Here, because the model is stochastic and features mobility, it organically leads to well-behaved steady-states and finite elasticities of wealth with respect to the net-of-tax rate, under a wide range of economic behaviors, and without the need to resort to ad hoc modeling devices such as wealth in the utility function (e.g., Saez and Stantcheva, 2018). Because the continuous-time formalism is highly tractable, I can obtain simple formulas that combine and extend insights from earlier studies of progressive wealth taxation (e.g. Jakobsen et al., 2020;Saez and Zucman, 2019). Overview of the Methodology This paper uses a stochastic, continuous-time framework, and its methodology rests on two results from stochastic calculus. First, I use theorem to prove that two factors drive the dynamics of the wealth distribution: the mean and the variance of savings, conditional on wealth. This remains true even in models that feature heterogeneous agents and complex shocks: theorem shows that this complexity can be marginalized out, and therefore that the evolution of the wealth distribution can, under very general conditions, be summarized by a single stochastic differential equation (SDE). This SDE captures the two forces that shape\n[9] productivity: as tax rates increase, equality increases through wealth transfers, but productivity falls as agents are less incentivized to work due to lower post-tax incomes ( Figure 3 and Figure 4). As a demonstration of this, the free market (no tax) baseline always yields the highest productivity and lowest equality compared to the alternative tax models. Unlike standard theoretical models that rely on elasticity assumptions to capture this trade-off, we observe it as an emergent consequence of rational behavior. Example 3: AI Tax Gaming Strategies. Our AI simulations yield emergent strategic behaviors. High-income agents learn to avoid taxes by moving labor and thus income between tax Figure 3: Quantitative results in a one-step economy and the Open-Quadrant Gather-Trade-Build environment. a-b, The results of the AI Economist and the Saez tax are highly consistent in the one-step economy, both in terms of utilitarian social welfare (a) and the tax schedule (b). c-d, In the Gather-Trade-Build environment (GTB) with 4 and 10 agents, the AI Economist outperforms baselines when optimizing the utilitarian social welfare objective (c) and when optimizing the equality-times-productivity objective (d). e-f, Overall coin equality (e) and average productivity (f) achieved by each tax model in the 4-agent Open Quadrant scenario.

To identify the authors publishing on these topics, we have to refer to the module of authors. There are 10 nodes, and the largest nodes are represented by the following authors: Pestieau P., Marchand M., Lipszyc B., Jousten A., Boadway R., and Wibaut S. These core keywords also appear in the cited documents published by the following scholars: Ramsey F.P., Atkinson A.B., Sandmo A., Stiglitz J., and Diamond P.A. Besides them, there are almost 100 scholars in the first module searching for optimal taxation and using the cluster of keywords. The diagram in Figure 15 demonstrates the structure of topics and authors developing the knowledge in the optimal taxation field. How fiscal policy should be determined in the long run is one of the most important topics in macroeconomics. Taxation must be optimized to maximize the well-being of society. The fiscal optimum theory can offer a series of important lessons to the public decision maker; moreover, the recent theoretical progress in this field helps to build a link between academic research and practical guidance. The central objective of optimal taxation is not to maximize the national income, but to maximize the social welfare of the country because a decrease in population income is accompanied by a reduction in tax collections. Moreover, any analysis of the fiscal optimum aims to describe some taxes that the government could implement, not to explain the already existing taxes. Discussion and Conclusions This article\n[11] taxpayers would willingly reveal dishonest behaviour. Second, the tax rate is a parameter that cannot be easily manipulated in the real world, unlike other instruments (Slemrod, 2019). When it does vary, it typically Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jae/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jae/ejab005/6206537 by guest on 19 April 2021 does so for the whole population of relevant taxpayers-thus often precluding the possibility of large-scale behavioural experiments. The empirical literature has attempted to overcome these challenges in various ways, most notably by using quasi-experimental methods and laboratory experiments 1 . For example, the growing bunching literature has used changes in the tax schedule to estimate income responses to increases in tax rates (for a review, see Saez et al., 2012). The results largely show that taxpayers avoid higher rates by keeping their reported income low-a response that is, at least partly, linked to evasion. Laboratory experiments largely confirm the negative relationship between the tax rate and reported income. A laboratory setting, where it is possible to vary the tax rate and measure evasion precisely, reported that income decreases when the tax rate increases (Alm, 2012;Torgler, 2002). Much of the compliance literature has focused on domestic taxes-for the most part, income taxes. However, the same question on tax rates and evasion has been central to the trade liberalisation debate too. While trade liberalisation refers to a broader set of issues, the reduction of tariff rates is a central element to it. A strand of the trade liberalisation literature has therefore investigated the revenue effects of such tariff reductions. The immediate mechanical effect of a decrease\n[12] to make simplifications in the interest of analytical tractability (20). For example, typical models use static, one-step economies (21,22) and make use of assumptions about people's sensitivity to tax changes (elasticity). Although work in New Dynamic Public Finance (NDPF) (23,24) seeks to model multi-step economies, these models quickly become intractable to study analytically. Concrete results are only available for two-step economies (25). These theoretical models also lack interactions between agents, such as market-based trading, and consider simple, inter-temporal dynamics. Previous simulation work that makes use of agent-based modeling (ABM) (26-31) avoids problems of analytical tractability but uses complex and ad hoc behavioral rules to study emergent behavior, this complicating the interpretation of results. Moreover, the behavior of ABM agents is often rigid and lacking in strategic or adaptive behavior. Experimental Validation. We provide extensive proof that the AI Economist provides a sound, effective, and viable approach to understanding, evaluating, and designing economic policy design. We study optimal tax design in a single-step economy and the multi-step Gather-Trade-Build environment, which implements a dynamic economy of heterogeneous, interacting agents that is more complex than the economic environments assumed in state-of-the-art tax models. We show that the use of RL yields emergent agent behaviors that align well with economic intuition, such as specialization and tax gaming, phenomena that are not captured through analytical approaches to tax policy design. This happens even with a small number of agents (4 and 10 agents in our experiments). We show that policy models using two-level RL are effective, flexible, and robust to strategic\n[13] other. Much less vast, but closely related to our paper, is the literature studying the role of microeconomic heterogeneity at shaping the interaction between the epidemic and the economy. Considering heterogeneity across households, Kaplan et al. (2020) integrate the SIR model into a framework with income and wealth inequality, as well as occupational and sectoral heterogeneity, to study the distributional and welfare effects associated with the US policy response to the pandemic. The health and economic policies they consider entail large and heterogeneous welfare costs across households. Hur (2020) integrates a SIR model into an heterogeneous agent-life cycle economy. He designs Pareto-improving mitigation policies, and shows that the latter can reduce deaths by nearly 60 percent relative to a no mitigation scenario. Eichenbaum et al. (2021) develop a two agents model consistent with the observation that the health of low wage workers has been disproportionately affected by the pandemic. Our paper is complementary to these analysis, since it considers heterogeneity in the supply side of the economy. We integrate the SIR epidemiological model into a New Keynesian Industry Dynamic framework with two sectors, heterogeneous firms and endogenous entry and exit dynamics in order to study the effects of the pandemic and social distancing measures on productivity and business dynamism. Firm level heterogeneity is modeled similarly to Clementi and Palazzo (2016), Hamano and Zanetti (2017), and Rossi (2019). The focus on the first wave of the epidemic allows to isolate the economic effects resulting from the behavioral response of households to the pandemic, consistently with the propagation\n[14] issues and achieve social objectives. For example, tax policy needs to balance equality and productivity, as large inequality gaps cause loss of economic opportunity (1) and adverse health effects (2). However, the problem of optimal policy design is very challenging, even when the policy objectives can be agreed upon. Policy optimization poses a mechanism design (3) problem: the government (social planner) aims to find a policy under which the (boundedly) rational behaviors of affected economic agents yield the desired social outcome. Theoretical approaches to policy design are limited by analytical tractability and thus fail to capture the complexity of the real world. Empirical studies are challenged by the lack of counterfactual data and face the Lucas critique (4) that historical data do not capture behavioral responses to policy behavior. Furthermore, opportunities for rigorous, real-world experimentation are limited and come with ethical questions (5). Computational and machine learning techniques for automated mechanism design (6-10) show promise towards overcoming existing limitations, but a general computational framework for policy design remains lacking. The challenge with policy design comes from needing to solve a highly non-stationary, two-level, sequential decision-making problem where all actors (the agents and the government) are learning: economic agents learn rational, utility-maximizing behaviors and the government learns to optimize its own objective via policy choices. A New Machine Learning Challenge. Using deep reinforcement learning (RL) with multiple agents has been underexplored as a solution framework for mechanism design. Recent advances in deep RL have mostly studied the single-level setting; for example, state-of-the-art deep RL systems such as\n[15] tail of the income distribution, whereas income tax progressivity is determined by the right tail of the distribution. Related literature.-This paper belongs to a large literature on optimal taxation. Seminal papers in the Mirrleesian tradition include Mirrlees (1971), Diamond (1998), and Saez (2001). At a general level, our Ramsey approach with flexible t&T functional forms allows for a quantitative evaluation of the main trade-offs discussed in this literature within a rich dynamic model. Our paper relates more closely to Heathcote and Tsujiyama (2021), which compares a fully nonlinear Mirrlees plan to a log-linear tax system in a static environment. In a setup comparable to theirs, we show that adding an intercept to a log-linear income tax function comes systematically close to the Mirrlees plan, a result that holds across several calibrations, including theirs (see sec. II). We further consider targeted transfers and embed our analysis in a dynamic general equilibrium model in section IV. Also related to our paper are Chang and Park (2021) and Park (2022), which use a variational approach to derive a tax formula in an Aiyagari model with Greenwood, Hercowitz, and Huffman (1988) preferences. Our Ramsey approach allows for intuitive insights as well as the inclusion of transitions from the calibrated steady state in welfare computations. 3 Our quantitative framework relates to several papers interested in optimal tax progressivity in incomplete market models. An early contribution is Conesa and Krueger (2006), and subsequent work has focused on transitional dynamics (Bak\u0131\u015f, Kaymak, and Poschke 2015), superstars and entrepreneurs (Br\u00fcggemann 2021;Kindermann and Krueger 2022),\n[16] et al. (2010) find that the optimal income taxation structure to maximize social welfare is only a two-parameter function, that embraces the level of taxation and the progressivity of tax, as it will be clarified in section 3. Using this, and also, other income taxation approaches, Guner et al. (2014) find that it is possible to reduce the Gini Index from 0,56 to 0,55 only by using labor taxation. Although this is a useful measure to reduce income inequality, taxation can create an adverse effect. As the government increases progressive taxation, agents have less incentive to work, and they prefer to invest less in skills, which can create even more heterogeneity (Golosov et al. (2016); Heathcote et al. (2017); Stiglitz (1982)). Progressive taxation is essential to redistribute after-tax income across ex-ante heterogeneous households. Thus an optimal policy can create beneficial effects on society. Krueger et al. (2013) found optimal labor taxation of 34,1% taking into account skilled and unskilled households and, concluded that this taxation leads to a lower Gini index, higher GDP and consumption, and more people deciding to go to college. Model The model used is an incomplete markets economy with uninsurable idiosyncratic risk and heterogeneous agents. There are two types of households that derive utility from consumption and leisure. Skilled agents born with particular abilities, such as intelligence, creativity, and physical force, that allow them to execute tasks that are a complement to capital. On the other hand, unskilled households have attributes that enable them to substitute capital. Both types face an idiosyncratic\n[17] outcomes are more likely under carbon markets than taxes. As the reviewed ABM studies do not address this topic, future ones might test this, by comparing how the two types of carbon pricing perform in terms of effectiveness of emissions reduction under bounded rationality of, and social interactions among, consumers and producers. The reviewed macroeconomic ABMs study distinct policies and policy mixes. But they have not much contributed to the long-standing debate on a double dividend (e.g., positive effects on employment and emissions reduction) of an environmental tax reform, that is, shifting taxes from labor to carbon (Goulder, 1995). This could add more insight about the particular role of bounded rationality and social interactions, as well as the role of low-carbon innovation, which are missing in conventional general equilibrium studies that dominate this topic. Since ABMs describe multiple agents and heterogeneity, they are also well suited to address the role of inequality in relation to environmental tax reform. Next, the study of information provision strategies in climate policy is difficult in traditional equilibrium models but more straightforward in ABMs. Indeed, we find that several ABM studies in our review addressed this issue, particularly in the theme of energy conservation. However, they do not span the full scope of relevant instruments: Information campaigns (targeting very distinct population groups), green awards, the role of traditional versus Internet-based social media, and regulation of advertising of high-carbon goods and services deserve attention as well. Additional research employing ABM could test whether it is more effective for emissions reduction to stimulate\n[18] TaxAI: A Dynamic Economic Simulator and Benchmark for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Taxation and government spending are crucial tools for governments to promote economic growth and maintain social equity. However, the difficulty in accurately predicting the dynamic strategies of diverse self-interested households presents a challenge for governments to implement effective tax policies. Given its proficiency in modeling other agents in partially observable environments and adaptively learning to find optimal policies, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is highly suitable for solving dynamic games between the government and numerous households. Although MARL shows more potential than traditional methods such as the genetic algorithm and dynamic programming, there is a lack of large-scale multi-agent reinforcement learning economic simulators. Therefore, we propose a MARL environment, named \\textbf{TaxAI}, for dynamic games involving $N$ households, government, firms, and financial intermediaries based on the Bewley-Aiyagari economic model. Our study benchmarks 2 traditional economic methods with 7 MARL methods on TaxAI, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of MARL algorithms. Moreover, TaxAI's scalability in simulating dynamic interactions between the government and 10,000 households, coupled with real-data calibration, grants it a substantial improvement in scale and reality over existing simulators. Therefore, TaxAI is the most realistic economic simulator for optimal tax policy, which aims to generate feasible recommendations for governments and individuals.\n[19] the Canadian Tax Foundation), 48 Stephan Zheng et al., \"The AI Economist: Improving Equality and Productivity with AI-Driven Tax Policies,\" April 28, 2020 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13332). 49 See ibid., at 3: \"The AI-driven tax policies make use of different kinds of tax rate schedules than those suggested by baseline policies, and our experiments demonstrate that the AI-driven tax policy can improve the trade-off between equality and productivity by 16% when compared to the prominent Saez tax framework.\" 50 As representative contributions from the optimal tax literature that form the basis of the Saez framework, the authors cite, inter alia, Emmanuel Saez, \"Using Elasticities To Derive Optimal Income Tax Rates\" (2001) tim edgar, machine-learning, and the future of anti-avoidance n 627 industry organizations, politicians, political parties, and non-governmental organizations. 51 Of course, the imperatives of fiscal policy and of financing government itself probably provide the greatest impetus for further development of the law through direct changes to tax legislation. In the long run, tax law will reach functional completeness through these internal and external mechanisms. For now, however, the tax law is incomplete. This incompleteness means that taxpayers must often proceed without knowing for certain how the gaps in the tax law will be filled by tax policy makers, tax administrators, and (if it comes to that) judges. These various groups may not agree on whether and how our incompletely specified tax law will apply to the taxpayer's situation. Indeed, because taxation at the point of interpretation and application represents a zerosum transfer (some would argue a negative sum,\n[20] temporary or permanent.

Burst term refers to a spike in the use of a keyword or citation of a publication over a period of time, and it is critical to define the research frontier for a specific scientific subject. The larger the burst, the faster the frequency of citations grows. A cited document burst occurs when the number of document citations suddenly increases. The top 15 cited documents with the strongest citation bursts in different time periods are listed in Figure 7. It displays the date and duration of each document's first citation. The blue lines represent the whole study period, while the red lines represent the duration of each paper's citation bursts. It reflects the document's continued significance in the field of optimal taxation research. . Saez E. presents three reasons for using elasticities to derive optimal tax rates (1-it is straightforward to obtain an optimal tax formula for high incomes; 2-the elasticity method shows exactly which are the relevant parameters for optimal taxation; and 3-numerical simulations can be performed using the empirical income distribution). Conesa J.C. and his colleagues found that a system that taxes capital heavily and taxes labor income according\n[21] libertarianism. Furthermore, we can identify influential scholars based on citation bursts, or when a scholar is quoted a great deal in a short period of time. The citations of 103 scholars have been bursting before 2021, including Piketty T., Chetty R., Atkinson A.B., Stern N.H., and Farhi E. The top 15 cited authors with the largest citation burst are shown in Figure 9. Because of their considerable impact on optimal taxation research, these writers' papers are worth researching. For instance, Piketty T. published in 2013 and 2014 two valuable papers that are heavily cited by researchers. The first paper was written in collaboration with Saez E. Their first study developed optimal inheritance tax formulas that take into account the important equity-efficiency trade-off. The authors looked at dynamic stochastic models with a wide range of bequest preferences and labor productivity. They showed that if the bequest elasticity is low, bequest concentration is high, and society cares most about those receiving a little inheritance, the optimal tax rate is positive and quantitatively large. In the second paper, Piketty T. has Saez E. and Stantcheva S. as co-authors. Their second paper produced optimal top tax rate formulas in a model, where top earners respond to taxes through three channels: labor supply, tax avoidance, and compensation negotiating. They show that when there are zero-sum compensation-bargaining effects, the efficient top tax rate rises. The formulas for optimal tax and social insurance policies derived by Chetty R. and Saez E. highlight two general parameters as the determinants of how\n[22] between the AI Economist and baselines are statistically significant, except for the difference in social welfare between the AI Economist and the Saez tax in the one-step economy (a). years in order to move more income to low-rate brackets. This can reduce the overall tax paid in comparison to earning a constant amount each year (Figure 6c). Given the complexity of Gather-Trade-Build and similar dynamic economic environments, it is prohibitively complex for theory-driven methods to derive such temporal behavioral strategies. Together, these examples show that AI-driven simulations capture features of real-world economies, purely through RL. Hence, AI-driven simulations provide a rich class of environments for policy design, unconstrained by analytic tractability. AI-Driven Optimal Taxation We evaluate the AI Economist across different Gather-Trade-Build economies to validate that AI-driven policy design is effective, can be applied to different economic environments, and adapts to strategic behavior more successfully than baseline tax policies.

We find this parametric assumption attractive because it is flexible enough to nest most of the standard social welfare functions used in the literature, but not so flexible that it can rationalize any observed tax system, so that we can still ask how the current tax system could be improved. In addition, our specification allows for a closed-form mapping between structural model parameters, including the observed progressivity of the tax system, and the planner's taste for redistribution. Chetty and Saez (2010) is one of the few papers to explore the interaction between public and private insurance in environments with private information. They consider a range of alternative environments, in most of which agents face a single idiosyncratic shock that can be insured privately or publicly. Section III of their paper explores a more similar environment to ours, in which there are two components of productivity and differential roles for public versus private insurance with respect to the two components. Like us, they conclude that the government should focus on insuring the source of risk that cannot be insured privately. Relative to Chetty and Saez (2010), our contributions are twofold: (i) we consider optimal Mirrleesian tax policy in addition to affine tax systems, and (ii) our analysis is more quantitative in nature. Environment Labor Productivity There is a unit mass of agents. Agents differ only with respect to labor productivity w,\n[24] behavioral responses (the Lucas critique). Moreover, existing simulation-based approaches often do not consider both strategic planners and agents, or interactions between actors (4-6). Such complex settings include income taxation (tax policy changes the post-tax utility that economic agents experience) and pandemics (Federal subsidies can lighten the economic burden on citizens and may incentivize US states to employ more stringent public health policies). As a case study, we show how our framework can optimize public health and economic policies for both public health (e.g., reducing COVID-19 deaths) and the economy (e.g., maintaining productivity) during a pandemic. Using real data, we simulate COVID-19, vaccinations, and unemployment in the United States.

First, it can refer to the decisions made by a social planner (government), as in \"public policy\" and akin to a mechanism (1). Second, it may refer to the behavioral policy model of agents, as is common in the reinforcement learning literature. In this work, \"policy\" and \"planner policy\" refer to the social planner, while \"behavioral policy\" and \"agent policy\"\n[25] taxpayers. The practical problem of any government is to establish the level of the optimal tax rate. For these reasons, the topics of taxation, in general, and tax optimization, in particular, are of significant interest to international researchers, out of the desire to propose relevant solutions to politicians. For instance, since 1975, there have been indexed in WoS more than 500,000 papers related to taxation (TS = (tax*)) and their number gradually increased from almost 1000 papers in 1975 to over 36,000 papers in 2020. Literature related to taxation can be considered rather as datasets that incorporate a variety of data, such as titles, publication years, authors, journals, keywords, and references. There is a large number of publications that contain a large amount of data inside such that it can be inefficient and even impossible to collect and compile it manually. The intellectual structure of any research field, including optimal taxation, can be identified through the quantitative examination of this information and its interconnections. The credibility of research is known to be usually directly related to the method used. The bibliometric analysis brings objectivity and legitimacy to the literature review process. The bibliometric analysis raises the accuracy of the scientific literature and avoids or reduces the bias of researchers on literature review. Furthermore, by synthesizing the expertise of many researchers in the field, the research gains credibility. The objective of this study was to explore the global scientific literature on optimal tax policy based on a scientometric inquiry to track its evolution in\n[26] and changes in marginal tax rates. By measuring the degree to which taxpayers' bunch at kink points, the author explores \"bunching\" at US income tax kinks. According to the results of his study, the reaction cannot always be equal, and most kinks do not generate statistically noticeable bunching responses. In addition, the scientist indicates that significant changes in taxation do not always cause a strong response. The main impetus for studying behavioral responses in tax area is the search of better tax policy and optimal taxation. Much attention is given to the 1986 Tax Reform Act and its implications on households. This document explored by Gerald Auten and Robert Carroll is a natural experiment caused income inequality.. The authors examine the roles of taxes and various non-tax factors significantly affecting households. For example, mathematical models show that a line of work does not affect taxation. According to the author, the key influence is the rate, which considerably changes behavior of taxpayers. It is also established that during the late 1980s growth of relative income relates to behavioral responses to the tax changes. The research on inheritance tax statistics by David Julfayan gives a detailed description of estate taxation affecting bequests. The study is conducted on the basis of time series data from federal estate tax revenues. It is shown that using property tax and inheritance tax taxpayers estimates the expected rate of return differently in similar situations. The scientist proves that Taxes on capital may have influence on saving decisions by reducing rates of\n[27] In particular, we will compare the following tax models: \u2022 free-market (no taxes), \u2022 US federal single-filer tax schedule, \u2022 Saez tax formula (adapted for a multi-period setting), and \u2022 the AI Economist planner. The specific tax rates set by these models are depicted in Figure . See the related work (Section . ) for a broader discussion on the various tax frameworks proposed in the optimal tax literature, including linear tax models and analytical approaches to dynamic taxation in sequential economies. All tax models set tax rates for a bracketed tax schedule, and use the same income brackets, following the US federal income tax schedule and scaling so that USD corresponds to Coin: Saez Tax Formula (single-period). A prominent analytical treatment of optimal taxation is given by Saez [ , who proposes a closed-form solution for optimal tax rates in a single-period economy. Let and F denote the probability density and cumulative density function on income, respectively. The Saez framework assumes the planner can observe the population's distribution over incomes z \u223c (z). Here, z and the associated density functions refer to pre-tax income within a single tax period. Saez [  works with the linear-weighted family of social welfare functions (Eq ), and defines the social marginal welfare weights as Weight g i represents the change in social welfare due to a change in agent i's endowment. The weights \u03c9 i , and implied social marginal welfare weights, g i , parameterize the planner's objective, and encode a social choice, for example emphasizing agents\n[28] to review, we only discuss the subset of papers that focus on the theory and applications. Abel and Panageas (2021) study an optimal control problem as well as the laissez-faire equilibrium in an SIR model with population growth and show that a steady state exists and the disease becomes endemic regardless of the cost of excess deaths. Budish (2020) conceptualizes R \u2264 1 (effective reproduction number less than 1) as a constraint, discusses the optimal policy in a static setting with heterogeneous economic activities, and illustrates that cheap policies such as mask-wearing go a long way in containing the virus spread with minimal welfare costs. Toxvaerd (2020) studies an SIR model with endogenous social distancing, which is similar to ours. Assuming linear utility and costs, he shows that susceptible agents either engage in no social distancing at all or social distance to maintain a target peak prevalence, which endogenously flattens the infection curve. Relative to this small literature of theoretical strategic epidemic models, our main contribution is that we explicitly model imperfect testing and enforcement and systematically study the welfare implications and optimal policies. Behavioral SIR model with imperfect testing We introduce rational and potentially undiagnosed agents into the basic Kermack and McKendrick (1927) Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemic model. Model We consider an infectious disease that can be transmitted between agents in a society, which consists of a large (but finite) number of agents indexed by n \u2208 N = {1, . . . , N }. Time is discrete, runs forever, and is denoted by t\n[29] to data-fitting econometric models, simple controlled thought experiments cannot paint a complete picture of the world, but only of a specific corner.In other words, causalities can only be theoretically, not empirically, identified.In this regard, we believe that concluding something is better than concluding nothing, but we admit that thought experiment is an alternative method to data-fitting modelling.On the other hand, compared to neoclassical theoretical models, our thought experiments do not impose rationality on individual behavior and equilibrium on aggregate behavior.In contrast to general equilibrium models in this tradition (e.g., CGE and DSGE) which assume an incredibly simple environment but unrealistically sophisticated agent, ABMs assume very simple agent but an extremely complex environment (Hamill & Gilbert, 2016).Nevertheless, a greater realism is a double-bladed sword-absence of the neoclassical ideology may imply a lack of theoretical convergence to equilibrium.The decision in modelling strategy really depends on the trade-off between theoretical elegance and practical relevance in answering the research question.Given the essential role of heterogeneity and interaction in explaining inequality and mobility, we believe that thought experiment can strike a good balance between the two desirable criteria. Literature Review Wealth inequality is a feature of the distribution across individuals at a point in time, while social mobility characterizes the transitions across the distribution over time.Given the entangled relationship between the two concepts, there has been a growing literature attempting to explain both within one framework (Benhabib et al., 2019;Fisher et al., 2016;De Nardi, 2004).

Traditional taxation systems, such as the U.S. federal income tax, aim to mitigate inequality but often lack adaptability to changing economic conditions and individual behaviors [0]. In response, various models have been proposed to optimize tax policies, including the Saez Optimal Taxation framework, which adjusts tax rates dynamically to balance equity and productivity [27].\n\nHowever, existing models like Saez's often fail to account for taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior, which are crucial factors in determining the effectiveness of tax policies [6]. Recent studies have emphasized the importance of incorporating behavioral aspects into tax policy design, using techniques such as agent-based modeling (ABM) [12][14]. ABM allows for the simulation of complex interactions between heterogeneous agents, providing insights into emergent behaviors and outcomes.\n\nThe integration of large language models (LLMs) with ABM has shown promise in optimizing policy design, including taxation [19]. LLMs can process vast amounts of data and provide adaptive, data-driven solutions to complex problems [20]. By combining LLMs with ABM, researchers can create more realistic and responsive models of economic systems. This approach enables the simulation of dynamic interactions between governments, households, and firms, allowing for the evaluation of tax policies in a more nuanced and realistic context.\n\nFor instance, TaxAI, a multi-agent reinforcement learning environment, has been developed to simulate dynamic games between governments, households, and firms [19]. Similarly, the AI Economist framework uses reinforcement learning to optimize tax policies in dynamic economic environments [18]. Additionally, Atlas, a retrieval-augmented language model, has demonstrated effectiveness in reducing hallucinations and improving parameter efficiency compared to non-retrieval augmented LMs [2].\n\nIn comparison to these approaches, TaxAgent offers a more comprehensive framework for tax policy design, incorporating both LLMs and ABM to simulate real-world taxpayer behaviors and optimize tax rates [abstract]. While TaxAI and the AI Economist focus on specific aspects of tax policy design, such as dynamic games and reinforcement learning, TaxAgent provides a more integrated approach, balancing equity and productivity in a more realistic and responsive economic environment.\n\nThe advantages of integrating LLMs with ABM include the ability to capture complex behaviors and interactions, as well as to provide adaptive and data-driven solutions [19]. However, there are also limitations to this approach, such as the need for high-quality data and the potential for biased outcomes if the LLMs are not properly trained [20].\n\nIn terms of applications, TaxAgent's performance can be evaluated in various economic sectors, such as labor markets [24], capital markets [25], and international trade [26]. Furthermore, its impact on economic stability and racial justice can be assessed in different countries, including low-income countries [7]. By examining TaxAgent's performance in diverse scenarios, policymakers can gain insights into its potential to address economic inequality and promote social welfare.\n\nOur study builds on this literature by introducing TaxAgent, a novel integration of LLMs with ABM, designed to optimize adaptive tax policies that balance equity and productivity. By benchmarking TaxAgent against traditional tax systems, such as the Saez Optimal Taxation framework and the U.S. federal income tax, we demonstrate the potential of this approach to achieve superior equity-efficiency trade-offs.\n\n## References\n\n[0] Roberts et al.

Together, these proposals offer more efficient and equitable sources of revenue than court debt. When reformulating their tax systems, states and municipalities should consider racial equity.

Considering heterogeneity across households, Kaplan et al. (2020) integrate the SIR model into a framework with income and wealth inequality, as well as occupational and sectoral heterogeneity, to study the distributional and welfare effects associated with the US policy response to the pandemic. The health and economic policies they consider entail large and heterogeneous welfare costs across households. Hur (2020) integrates a SIR model into an heterogeneous agent-life cycle economy. He designs Pareto-improving mitigation policies, and shows that the latter can reduce deaths by nearly 60 percent relative to a no mitigation scenario. Eichenbaum et al. (2021) develop a two agents model consistent with the observation that the health of low wage workers has been disproportionately affected by the pandemic. Our paper is complementary to these analysis, since it considers heterogeneity in the supply side of the economy.\n\n[18] 48 Stephan Zheng et al., \"The AI Economist: Improving Equality and Productivity with AI-Driven Tax Policies,\" April 28, 2020 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13332). 49 See ibid., at 3: \"The AI-driven tax policies make use of different kinds of tax rate schedules than those suggested by baseline policies, and our experiments demonstrate that the AI-driven tax policy can improve the trade-off between equality and productivity by 16% when compared to the prominent Saez tax framework.\" 50 As representative contributions from the optimal tax literature that form the basis of the Saez framework, the authors cite, inter alia, Emmanuel Saez, \"Using Elasticities To Derive Optimal Income Tax Rates\" (2001) tim edgar, machine-learning, and the future of anti-avoidance n 627 industry organizations, politicians, political parties, and non-governmental organizations. 51 Of course, the imperatives of fiscal policy and of financing government itself probably provide the greatest impetus for further development of the law through direct changes to tax legislation. In the long run, tax law will reach functional completeness through these internal and external mechanisms. For now, however, the tax law is incomplete. This incompleteness means that taxpayers must often proceed without knowing for certain how the gaps in the tax law will be filled by tax policy makers, tax administrators, and (if it comes to that) judges. These various groups may not agree on whether and how our incompletely specified tax law will apply to the taxpayer's situation. Indeed, because taxation at the point of interpretation and application represents a zerosum transfer (some would argue a negative sum,\n\n[19] Therefore, we propose a MARL environment, named \\textbf{TaxAI}, for dynamic games involving $N$ households, government, firms, and financial intermediaries based on the Bewley-Aiyagari economic model. Our study benchmarks 2 traditional economic methods with 7 MARL methods on TaxAI, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of MARL algorithms. Moreover, TaxAI's scalability in simulating dynamic interactions between the government and 10,000 households, coupled with real-data calibration, grants it a substantial improvement in scale and reality over existing simulators. Therefore, TaxAI is the most realistic economic simulator for optimal tax policy, which aims to generate feasible recommendations for governments and individuals.\n\n[22] The reviewed macroeconomic ABMs study distinct policies and policy mixes. But they have not much contributed to the long-standing debate on a double dividend (e.g., positive effects on employment and emissions reduction) of an environmental tax reform, that is, shifting taxes from labor to carbon (Goulder, 1995). This could add more insight about the particular role of bounded rationality and social interactions, as well as the role of low-carbon innovation, which are missing in conventional general equilibrium studies that dominate this topic. Since ABMs describe multiple agents and heterogeneity, they are also well suited to address the role of inequality in relation to environmental tax reform. Next, the study of information provision strategies in climate policy is difficult in traditional equilibrium models but more straightforward in ABMs. Indeed, we find that several ABM studies in our review addressed this issue, particularly in the theme of energy conservation.\n\n[24] behavioral responses (the Lucas critique). Moreover, existing simulation-based approaches often do not consider both strategic planners and agents, or interactions between actors (4-6). Such complex settings include income taxation (tax policy changes the post-tax utility that economic agents experience) and pandemics (Federal subsidies can lighten the economic burden on citizens and may incentivize US states to employ more stringent public health policies). As a case study, we show how our framework can optimize public health and economic policies for both public health (e.g., reducing COVID-19 deaths) and the economy (e.g., maintaining productivity) during a pandemic. Using real data, we simulate COVID-19, vaccinations, and unemployment in the United States.\n\n[27] The specific tax rates set by these models are depicted in Figure .

Tax codes are incredibly complex and may be daunting to the nonexpert. For example, the U.S. Tax Code (Title 26) is over 2,600 pages in length, but the Internal Revenue Service Form 1040 greatly simplifies this into a few pages that the average person can easily navigate to correctly pay their income tax. Similarly, common evolution equations, including the Hardy-Weinberg principle and its extensions that include natural selection and mutation, are often abstract and nonintuitive for students due to the combination of italicized letters and multiple orders of operations. This disconnect from everyday concepts is a persistent obstacle to understanding evolution (Hanisch & Eirdosh, 2020). Just as Form 1040, with its associated tax table and income adjustment schedules, seeks to simplify calculations into a series of fillable lines, our objective was to design similar forms that deconstruct evolution equations into discrete boxes that students fill in to guide them through the process. This technique reduces the prevalence of common errors, including missteps in the order of operations. c Evolution Equations The most common series of equations that students encounter while learning about genetic evolution is the Hardy-Weinberg principle. This concept serves as the null hypothesis that a population in equilibrium is not evolving. For the population to be in equilibrium, it must not experience any of the following conditions: mutation, selection, genetic drift, gene flow, or nonrandom mating.

Recent studies have emphasized the importance of incorporating behavioral aspects into tax policy design, using techniques such as agent-based modeling (ABM) [12][14]. ABM allows for the simulation of complex interactions between heterogeneous agents, providing insights into emergent behaviors and outcomes.\n\nThe integration of large language models (LLMs) with ABM has shown promise in optimizing policy design, including taxation [19]. LLMs can process vast amounts of data and provide adaptive, data-driven solutions to complex problems [20]. By combining LLMs with ABM, researchers can create more realistic and responsive models of economic systems. This approach enables the simulation of dynamic interactions between governments, households, and firms, allowing for the evaluation of tax policies in a more nuanced and realistic context.\n\nFor instance, TaxAI, a multi-agent reinforcement learning environment, has been developed to simulate dynamic games between governments, households, and firms [19]. Similarly, the AI Economist framework uses reinforcement learning to optimize tax policies in dynamic economic environments [18]. Additionally, Atlas, a retrieval-augmented language model, has demonstrated effectiveness in reducing hallucinations and improving parameter efficiency compared to non-retrieval augmented LMs [2].\n\nThe advantages of integrating LLMs with ABM include the ability to capture complex behaviors and interactions, as well as to provide adaptive and data-driven solutions [19]. However, there are also limitations to this approach, such as the need for high-quality data and the potential for biased outcomes if the LLMs are not properly trained [20].\n\nIn terms of applications, TaxAgent's performance can be evaluated in various economic sectors, such as labor markets [24], capital markets [25], and international trade [26]. Furthermore, its impact on economic stability and racial justice can be assessed in different countries, including low-income countries [7]. By examining TaxAgent's performance in diverse scenarios, policymakers can gain insights into its potential to address economic inequality and promote social welfare.\n\nOur study builds on this literature by introducing TaxAgent, a novel integration of LLMs with ABM, designed to optimize adaptive tax policies that balance equity and productivity. By benchmarking TaxAgent against traditional tax systems, such as the Saez Optimal Taxation framework and the U.S. federal income tax, we demonstrate the potential of this approach to achieve superior equity-efficiency trade-offs.\n\n## References\n\n[0] Roberts et al.
