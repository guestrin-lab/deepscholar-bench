MTP has shown promise in improving downstream performance, inference\nspeed, and training efficiency, particularly for large models.

Here is the paper abstract:\nAction coordination in human structure is indispensable for the spatial\nconstraints of 2D joints to recover 3D pose. Usually, action coordination is\nrepresented as a long-range dependence among body parts. However, there are two\nmain challenges in modeling long-range dependencies. First, joints should not\nonly be constrained by other individual joints but also be modulated by the\nbody parts. Second, existing methods make networks deeper to learn dependencies\nbetween non-linked parts. They introduce uncorrelated noise and increase the\nmodel size. In this paper, we utilize a pyramid structure to better learn\npotential long-range dependencies. It can capture the correlation across joints\nand groups, which complements the context of the human sub-structure. In an\neffective cross-scale way, it captures the pyramid-structured long-range\ndependence. Specifically, we propose a novel Pyramid Graph Attention (PGA)\nmodule to capture long-range cross-scale dependencies. It concatenates\ninformation from various scales into a compact sequence, and then computes the\ncorrelation between scales in parallel. Combining PGA with graph convolution\nmodules, we develop a Pyramid Graph Transformer (PGFormer) for 3D human pose\nestimation, which is a lightweight multi-scale transformer architecture. It\nencapsulates human sub-structures into self-attention by pooling.

To address this drawback, we propose a novel\nframework, Diversify and Conquer (DAC), to enhance SSL robustness in the\ncontext of open-set semi-supervised learning. In particular, we note that\nexisting open-set SSL methods rely on prediction discrepancies between inliers\nand outliers from a single model trained on labeled data. This approach can be\neasily failed when the labeled data is insufficient, leading to performance\ndegradation that is worse than naive SSL that do not account for outliers. In\ncontrast, our approach exploits prediction disagreements among multiple models\nthat are differently biased towards the unlabeled distribution. By leveraging\nthe discrepancies arising from training on unlabeled data, our method enables\nrobust outlier detection even when the labeled data is underspecified. Our key\ncontribution is constructing a collection of differently biased models through\na single training process. By encouraging divergent heads to be differently\nbiased towards outliers while making consistent predictions for inliers, we\nexploit the disagreement among these heads as a measure to identify unknown\nconcepts.

PnP\napproaches, a class of iterative algorithms where regularization is implicitly\nperformed by an off-the-shelf deep denoiser, are flexible for varying\ncompression ratios (CRs) but are limited in reconstruction accuracy and speed.\nConversely, unrolling approaches, a class of multi-stage neural networks where\na truncated iterative optimization process is transformed into an end-to-end\ntrainable network, typically achieve better accuracy with faster inference but\nrequire fine-tuning or even retraining when CR changes. In this paper, we\naddress the challenge of integrating the strengths of both classes of solvers.\nTo this end, we design an efficient deep image restorer (DIR) for the unrolling\nof HQS (half quadratic splitting) and ADMM (alternating direction method of\nmultipliers).

However,\ntraditional UDA-SS methods assume that category settings between source and\ntarget domains are known, which is unrealistic in real-world scenarios. This\nleads to performance degradation if private classes exist. To address this\nlimitation, we propose Universal Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation\n(UniDA-SS), achieving robust adaptation even without prior knowledge of\ncategory settings. We define the problem in the UniDA-SS scenario as low\nconfidence scores of common classes in the target domain, which leads to\nconfusion with private classes. To solve this problem, we propose UniMAP:\nUniDA-SS with Image Matching and Prototype-based Distinction, a novel framework\ncomposed of two key components. First, Domain-Specific Prototype-based\nDistinction (DSPD) divides each class into two domain-specific prototypes,\nenabling finer separation of domain-specific features and enhancing the\nidentification of common classes across domains.

While current deep-learning-based\nmethods using the traditional dense vector search pipeline, i.e.,\nrepresentation-index-search, achieve remarkable accuracy, they face several\nlimitations that impede further performance improvements: (i) the errors\naccumulated during the table representation and indexing phases affect the\nsubsequent search accuracy; and (ii) insufficient query-table interaction\nhinders effective semantic alignment, impeding accuracy improvements. In this\npaper, we propose a novel framework Birdie, using a differentiable search\nindex. It unifies the indexing and search into a single encoder-decoder\nlanguage model, thus getting rid of error accumulations. Birdie first assigns\neach table a prefix-aware identifier and leverages a large language model-based\nquery generator to create synthetic queries for each table. It then encodes the\nmapping between synthetic queries/tables and their corresponding table\nidentifiers into the parameters of an encoder-decoder language model, enabling\ndeep query-table interactions. During search, the trained model directly\ngenerates table identifiers for a given query. To accommodate the continual\nindexing of dynamic tables, we introduce an index update strategy via parameter\nisolation, which mitigates the issue of catastrophic forgetting.

To address this challenge, this paper presents a 0-1\nlinear program for task-resource co-allocation, along with a multi-objective\nheuristic designed to minimize resource usage while guaranteeing schedulability\nunder a preemptive EDF scheduling policy.

Here is the paper abstract:\nSequential recommendation is a popular paradigm in modern recommender\nsystems. In particular, one challenging problem in this space is cross-domain\nsequential recommendation (CDSR), which aims to predict future behaviors given\nuser interactions across multiple domains. Existing CDSR frameworks are mostly\nbuilt on the self-attention transformer and seek to improve by explicitly\ninjecting additional domain-specific components (e.g. domain-aware module\nblocks). While these additional components help, we argue they overlook the\ncore self-attention module already present in the transformer, a naturally\npowerful tool to learn correlations among behaviors. In this work, we aim to\nimprove the CDSR performance for simple models from a novel perspective of\nenhancing the self-attention. Specifically, we introduce a Pareto-optimal\nself-attention and formulate the cross-domain learning as a multi-objective\nproblem, where we optimize the recommendation task while dynamically minimizing\nthe cross-domain attention scores. Our approach automates knowledge transfer in\nCDSR (dubbed as AutoCDSR) -- it not only mitigates negative transfer but also\nencourages complementary knowledge exchange among auxiliary domains. Based on\nthe idea, we further introduce AutoCDSR+, a more performant variant with slight\nadditional cost. Our proposal is easy to implement and works as a plug-and-play\nmodule that can be incorporated into existing transformer-based recommenders.\nBesides flexibility, it is practical to deploy because it brings little extra\ncomputational overheads without heavy hyper-parameter tuning.

Despite the great success, most existing MDR methods adopt a single\nstructure to transfer complex domain-shared knowledge. However, the beneficial\ntransferring information should vary across different domains. When there is\nknowledge conflict between domains or a domain is of poor quality,\nunselectively leveraging information from all domains will lead to a serious\nNegative Transfer Problem (NTP). Therefore, how to effectively model the\ncomplex transfer relationships between domains to avoid NTP is still a\ndirection worth exploring. To address these issues, we propose a simple and\ndynamic Similar Domain Selection Principle (SDSP) for multi-domain\nrecommendation in this paper. SDSP presents the initial exploration of\nselecting suitable domain knowledge for each domain to alleviate NTP.\nSpecifically, we propose a novel prototype-based domain distance measure to\neffectively model the complexity relationship between domains. Thereafter, the\nproposed SDSP can dynamically find similar domains for each domain based on the\nsupervised signals of the domain metrics and the unsupervised distance measure\nfrom the learned domain prototype.

STAR-Rec addresses these challenges by: (1) employing\npreference-aware attention to capture both inherently similar item\nrelationships and diverse preferences, (2) utilizing state-space modeling to\nefficiently process variable-length sequences with linear complexity, and (3)\nincorporating a mixture-of-experts component that adaptively routes different\nbehavioral patterns to specialized experts, handling both focused\ncategory-specific browsing and diverse category exploration patterns. We\ntheoretically demonstrate how the state space model and attention mechanisms\ncan be naturally unified in recommendation scenarios, where SSM captures\ntemporal dynamics through state compression while attention models both similar\nand diverse item relationships. Extensive experiments on four real-world\ndatasets demonstrate that STAR-Rec consistently outperforms state-of-the-art\nsequential recommendation methods, particularly in scenarios involving diverse\nuser behaviors and varying sequence lengths..\n", 'total_cost': 0}

Here is the paper abstract:\nGraph convolutional networks have recently gained prominence in collaborative\nfiltering (CF) for recommendations. However, we identify potential bottlenecks\nin two foundational components. First, the embedding layer leads to a latent\nspace with limited capacity, overlooking locally observed but potentially\nvaluable preference patterns. Also, the widely-used neighborhood aggregation is\nlimited in its ability to leverage diverse preference patterns in a\nfine-grained manner. Building on spectral graph theory, we reveal that these\nlimitations stem from graph filtering with a cut-off in the frequency spectrum\nand a restricted linear form. To address these issues, we introduce ChebyCF, a\nCF framework based on graph spectral filtering. Instead of a learned embedding,\nit takes a user's raw interaction history to utilize the full spectrum of\nsignals contained in it. Also, it adopts Chebyshev interpolation to effectively\napproximate a flexible non-linear graph filter, and further enhances it by\nusing an additional ideal pass filter and degree-based normalization. Through\nextensive experiments, we verify that ChebyCF overcomes the aforementioned\nbottlenecks and achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple\nbenchmarks and reasonably fast inference.

Here is the paper abstract:\nConversational recommendation systems (CRSs) use multi-turn interaction to\ncapture user preferences and provide personalized recommendations. A\nfundamental challenge in CRSs lies in effectively understanding user\npreferences from conversations. User preferences can be multifaceted and\ncomplex, posing significant challenges for accurate recommendations even with\naccess to abundant external knowledge. While interaction with users can clarify\ntheir true preferences, frequent user involvement can lead to a degraded user\nexperience.\n  To address this problem, we propose a generative reward model based simulated\nuser, named GRSU, for automatic interaction with CRSs. The simulated user\nprovides feedback to the items recommended by CRSs, enabling them to better\ncapture intricate user preferences through multi-turn interaction. Inspired by\ngenerative reward models, we design two types of feedback actions for the\nsimulated user: i.e., generative item scoring, which offers coarse-grained\nfeedback, and attribute-based item critique, which provides fine-grained\nfeedback. To ensure seamless integration, these feedback actions are unified\ninto an instruction-based format, allowing the development of a unified\nsimulated user via instruction tuning on synthesized data. With this simulated\nuser, automatic multi-turn interaction with CRSs can be effectively conducted.\nFurthermore, to strike a balance between effectiveness and efficiency, we draw\ninspiration from the paradigm of reward-guided search in complex reasoning\ntasks and employ beam search for the interaction process. On top of this, we\npropose an efficient candidate ranking method to improve the recommendation\nresults derived from interaction.

Here is the paper abstract:\nCross-domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) aims to extract the preference\nfrom the user's historical interactions across various domains. Despite some\nprogress in CDSR, two problems set the barrier for further advancements, i.e.,\noverlap dilemma and transition complexity. The former means existing CDSR\nmethods severely rely on users who own interactions on all domains to learn\ncross-domain item relationships, compromising the practicability. The latter\nrefers to the difficulties in learning the complex transition patterns from the\nmixed behavior sequences. With powerful representation and reasoning abilities,\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) are promising to address these two problems by\nbridging the items and capturing the user's preferences from a semantic view.\nTherefore, we propose an LLMs Enhanced Cross-domain Sequential Recommendation\nmodel (LLM4CDSR). To obtain the semantic item relationships, we first propose\nan LLM-based unified representation module to represent items. Then, a\ntrainable adapter with contrastive regularization is designed to adapt the CDSR\ntask. Besides, a hierarchical LLMs profiling module is designed to summarize\nuser cross-domain preferences. Finally, these two modules are integrated into\nthe proposed tri-thread framework to derive recommendations.

Here is the paper abstract:\nGenerative retrieval (GR) has emerged as a promising paradigm in information\nretrieval (IR). However, most existing GR models are developed and evaluated\nusing a static document collection, and their performance in dynamic corpora\nwhere document collections evolve continuously is rarely studied. In this\npaper, we first reproduce and systematically evaluate various representative GR\napproaches over dynamic corpora. Through extensive experiments, we reveal that\nexisting GR models with \\textit{text-based} docids show superior generalization\nto unseen documents. We observe that the more fine-grained the docid design in\nthe GR model, the better its performance over dynamic corpora, surpassing BM25\nand even being comparable to dense retrieval methods. While GR models with\n\\textit{numeric-based} docids show high efficiency, their performance drops\nsignificantly over dynamic corpora. Furthermore, our experiments find that the\nunderperformance of numeric-based docids is partly due to their excessive\ntendency toward the initial document set, which likely results from overfitting\non the training set. We then conduct an in-depth analysis of the\nbest-performing GR methods. We identify three critical advantages of text-based\ndocids in dynamic corpora: (i) Semantic alignment with language models'\npretrained knowledge, (ii) Fine-grained docid design, and (iii) High lexical\ndiversity. Building on these insights, we finally propose a novel multi-docid\ndesign that leverages both the efficiency of numeric-based docids and the\neffectiveness of text-based docids, achieving improved performance in dynamic\ncorpus without requiring additional retraining. Our work offers empirical\nevidence for advancing GR methods over dynamic corpora and paves the way for\ndeveloping more generalized yet efficient GR models in real-world search\nengines..\n", 'total_cost': 0}

Here is the paper abstract:\nFairness is an increasingly important factor in re-ranking tasks. Prior work\nhas identified a trade-off between ranking accuracy and item fairness. However,\nthe underlying mechanisms are still not fully understood. An analogy can be\ndrawn between re-ranking and the dynamics of economic transactions. The\naccuracy-fairness trade-off parallels the coupling of the commodity tax\ntransfer process. Fairness considerations in re-ranking, similar to a commodity\ntax on suppliers, ultimately translate into a cost passed on to consumers.\nAnalogously, item-side fairness constraints result in a decline in user-side\naccuracy. In economics, the extent to which commodity tax on the supplier (item\nfairness) transfers to commodity tax on users (accuracy loss) is formalized\nusing the notion of elasticity. The re-ranking fairness-accuracy trade-off is\nsimilarly governed by the elasticity of utility between item groups. This\ninsight underscores the limitations of current fair re-ranking evaluations,\nwhich often rely solely on a single fairness metric, hindering comprehensive\nassessment of fair re-ranking algorithms. Centered around the concept of\nelasticity, this work presents two significant contributions. We introduce the\nElastic Fairness Curve (EF-Curve) as an evaluation framework. This framework\nenables a comparative analysis of algorithm performance across different\nelasticity levels, facilitating the selection of the most suitable approach.\nFurthermore, we propose ElasticRank, a fair re-ranking algorithm that employs\nelasticity calculations to adjust inter-item distances within a curved space.\nExperiments on three widely used ranking datasets demonstrate its effectiveness\nand efficiency..\n", 'total_cost': 0}

Here is the paper abstract:\nRanking models primarily focus on modeling the relative order of predictions\nwhile often neglecting the significance of the accuracy of their absolute\nvalues. However, accurate absolute values are essential for certain downstream\ntasks, necessitating the calibration of the original predictions. To address\nthis, existing calibration approaches typically employ predefined\ntransformation functions with order-preserving properties to adjust the\noriginal predictions. Unfortunately, these functions often adhere to fixed\nforms, such as piece-wise linear functions, which exhibit limited\nexpressiveness and flexibility, thereby constraining their effectiveness in\ncomplex calibration scenarios. To mitigate this issue, we propose implementing\na calibrator using an Unconstrained Monotonic Neural Network (UMNN), which can\nlearn arbitrary monotonic functions with great modeling power. This approach\nsignificantly relaxes the constraints on the calibrator, improving its\nflexibility and expressiveness while avoiding excessively distorting the\noriginal predictions by requiring monotonicity. Furthermore, to optimize this\nhighly flexible network for calibration, we introduce a novel additional loss\nfunction termed Smooth Calibration Loss (SCLoss), which aims to fulfill a\nnecessary condition for achieving the ideal calibration state. Extensive\noffline experiments confirm the effectiveness of our method in achieving\nsuperior calibration performance.

Here is the paper abstract:\nGenerative retrieval seeks to replace traditional search index data\nstructures with a single large-scale neural network, offering the potential for\nimproved efficiency and seamless integration with generative large language\nmodels. As an end-to-end paradigm, generative retrieval adopts a learned\ndifferentiable search index to conduct retrieval by directly generating\ndocument identifiers through corpus-specific constrained decoding. The\ngeneralization capabilities of generative retrieval on out-of-distribution\ncorpora have gathered significant attention.\n  In this paper, we examine the inherent limitations of constrained\nauto-regressive generation from two essential perspectives: constraints and\nbeam search. We begin with the Bayes-optimal setting where the generative\nretrieval model exactly captures the underlying relevance distribution of all\npossible documents. Then we apply the model to specific corpora by simply\nadding corpus-specific constraints. Our main findings are two-fold: (i) For the\neffect of constraints, we derive a lower bound of the error, in terms of the KL\ndivergence between the ground-truth and the model-predicted step-wise marginal\ndistributions. (ii) For the beam search algorithm used during generation, we\nreveal that the usage of marginal distributions may not be an ideal approach.\nThis paper aims to improve our theoretical understanding of the generalization\ncapabilities of the auto-regressive decoding retrieval paradigm, laying a\nfoundation for its limitations and inspiring future advancements toward more\nrobust and generalizable generative retrieval..\n", 'total_cost': 0}
