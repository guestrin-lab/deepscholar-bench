However, taxation schemes are limited in their\nability to influence agents' preferences: an agent will always prefer to\nsatisfy its goal rather than otherwise, no matter what the costs. The\nfundamental question that we study is whether the principal can impose a\ntaxation scheme such that, in the resulting game, the principal's goal is\nsatisfied in at least one or all runs of the game that could arise by agents\nchoosing to follow game-theoretic equilibrium strategies. We consider two\ndifferent types of taxation schemes: in a static scheme, the same tax is\nimposed on a state-action profile pair in all circumstances, while in a dynamic\nscheme, the principal can choose to vary taxes depending on the circumstances.\nWe investigate the main game-theoretic properties of this model as well as the\ncomputational complexity of the relevant decision problems.",

The exploration of redistribution problems\nhas a long history in economics, offering valuable insights for conceptualizing\nfair re-ranking as a taxation process. Such a formulation provides us with a\nfresh perspective to re-examine fair re-ranking and inspire the development of\nnew methods. From a taxation perspective, we theoretically demonstrate that\nmost previous fair re-ranking methods can be reformulated as an item-level tax\npolicy. Ideally, a good tax policy should be effective and conveniently\ncontrollable to adjust ranking resources. However, both empirical and\ntheoretical analyses indicate that the previous item-level tax policy cannot\nmeet two ideal controllable requirements: (1) continuity, ensuring minor\nchanges in tax rates result in small accuracy and fairness shifts; (2)\ncontrollability over accuracy loss, ensuring precise estimation of the accuracy\nloss under a specific tax rate. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a\nnew fair re-ranking method named Tax-rank, which levies taxes based on the\ndifference in utility between two items. Then, we efficiently optimize such an\nobjective by utilizing the Sinkhorn algorithm in optimal transport. Upon a\ncomprehensive analysis, Our model Tax-rank offers a superior tax policy for\nfair re-ranking, theoretically demonstrating both continuity and\ncontrollability over accuracy loss. Experimental results show that Tax-rank\noutperforms all state-of-the-art baselines in terms of effectiveness and\nefficiency on recommendation and advertising tasks.",

We propose a model for the debt-to-GDP (Gross Domestic Product) ratio\nwhere the government interventions via fiscal policies affect the public debt\nand the GDP growth rate at the same time. We allow for stochastic interest rate\nand possible correlation with the GDP growth rate through the dependence of\nboth the processes (interest rate and GDP growth rate) on a stochastic factor\nwhich may represent any relevant macroeconomic variable, such as the state of\neconomy. We tackle the problem of a government whose goal is to determine the\nfiscal policy in order to minimize a general functional cost. We prove that the\nvalue function is a viscosity solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation\nand provide a Verification Theorem based on classical solutions. We investigate\nthe form of the candidate optimal fiscal policy in many cases of interest,\nproviding interesting policy insights. Finally, we discuss two applications to\nthe debt reduction problem and debt smoothing, providing explicit expressions\nof the value function and the optimal policy in some special cases.",

In the context of taxation, ABM has been applied to study the impact of tax policies on economic outcomes [3][4]. For instance, [5] used ABM to examine the effect of taxation on wealth distribution.\n\nThe integration of large language models (LLMs) with ABM is a relatively new area of research. LLMs have shown promise in various applications, including policy design and optimization [6][7]. Recent studies have explored the use of LLMs for fiscal policy analysis [8][9], including the evaluation of tax policies [10].\n\nThis study builds on these works by introducing TaxAgent, a novel integration of LLMs with ABM to design adaptive tax policies. Our approach combines the strengths of LLMs in processing complex data with the flexibility of ABM in simulating economic systems. The results of our simulation demonstrate superior equity-efficiency trade-offs compared to existing models.\n\n### References\n\n[1] Saez, E. (2010). Optimal taxation with endogenous human capital.
