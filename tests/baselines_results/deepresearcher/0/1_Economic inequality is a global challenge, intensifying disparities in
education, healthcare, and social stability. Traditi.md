Economic inequality and taxation are critical issues in macroeconomic policy design. Traditional taxation systems, such as the U.S. federal income tax, aim to reduce inequality but often lack adaptability [1]. The Saez Optimal Taxation model [2] is a notable approach that adjusts dynamically to address taxpayer behavior, but it does not fully account for taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior.

Agent-based modeling (ABM) has been increasingly used in economics to simulate complex systems and policy interventions. In the context of taxation, ABM has been applied to study the impact of tax policies on economic outcomes [3][4]. For instance, [5] used ABM to examine the effect of taxation on wealth distribution.

The integration of large language models (LLMs) with ABM is a relatively new area of research. LLMs have shown promise in various applications, including policy design and optimization [6][7]. Recent studies have explored the use of LLMs for fiscal policy analysis [8][9], including the evaluation of tax policies [10].

This study builds on these works by introducing TaxAgent, a novel integration of LLMs with ABM to design adaptive tax policies. Our approach combines the strengths of LLMs in processing complex data with the flexibility of ABM in simulating economic systems. The results of our simulation demonstrate superior equity-efficiency trade-offs compared to existing models.
