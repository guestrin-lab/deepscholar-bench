Here is the paper abstract:\nIn this paper, we propose an Aligned Contrastive Learning (ACL) algorithm to\naddress the long-tailed recognition problem. Our findings indicate that while\nmulti-view training boosts the performance, contrastive learning does not\nconsistently enhance model generalization as the number of views increases.\nThrough theoretical gradient analysis of supervised contrastive learning (SCL),\nwe identify gradient conflicts, and imbalanced attraction and repulsion\ngradients between positive and negative pairs as the underlying issues. Our ACL\nalgorithm is designed to eliminate these problems and demonstrates strong\nperformance across multiple benchmarks. We validate the effectiveness of ACL\nthrough experiments on long-tailed CIFAR, ImageNet, Places, and iNaturalist\ndatasets. Results show that ACL achieves new state-of-the-art performance.",
