Here is the paper abstract:\nRehearsal-based methods have shown superior performance in addressing\ncatastrophic forgetting in continual learning (CL) by storing and training on a\nsubset of past data alongside new data in current task. While such a concurrent\nrehearsal strategy is widely used, it remains unclear if this approach is\nalways optimal. Inspired by human learning, where sequentially revisiting tasks\nhelps mitigate forgetting, we explore whether sequential rehearsal can offer\ngreater benefits for CL compared to standard concurrent rehearsal. To address\nthis question, we conduct a theoretical analysis of rehearsal-based CL in\noverparameterized linear models, comparing two strategies: 1) Concurrent\nRehearsal, where past and new data are trained together, and 2) Sequential\nRehearsal, where new data is trained first, followed by revisiting past data\nsequentially. By explicitly characterizing forgetting and generalization error,\nwe show that sequential rehearsal performs better when tasks are less similar.\nThese insights further motivate a novel Hybrid Rehearsal method, which trains\nsimilar tasks concurrently and revisits dissimilar tasks sequentially. We\ncharacterize its forgetting and generalization performance, and our experiments\nwith deep neural networks further confirm that the hybrid approach outperforms\nstandard concurrent rehearsal. This work provides the first comprehensive\ntheoretical analysis of rehearsal-based CL.",
