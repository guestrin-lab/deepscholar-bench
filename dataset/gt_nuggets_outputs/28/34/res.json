Here is the paper abstract:\nInspired by the success of unsupervised pre-training paradigms, researchers\nhave applied these approaches to DNA pre-training. However, we argue that these\napproaches alone yield suboptimal results because pure DNA sequences lack\nsufficient information, since their functions are regulated by genomic profiles\nlike chromatin accessibility. Here, we demonstrate that supervised training for\ngenomic profile prediction serves as a more effective alternative to pure\nsequence pre-training. Furthermore, considering the multi-species and\nmulti-profile nature of genomic profile prediction, we introduce our\n$\\textbf{S}$pecies-$\\textbf{P}$rofile $\\textbf{A}$daptive\n$\\textbf{C}$ollaborative $\\textbf{E}$xperts (SPACE) that leverages Mixture of\nExperts (MoE) to better capture the relationships between DNA sequences across\ndifferent species and genomic profiles, thereby learning more effective DNA\nrepresentations. Through extensive experiments across various tasks, our model\nachieves state-of-the-art performance, establishing that DNA models trained\nwith supervised genomic profiles serve as powerful DNA representation learners.\nThe code is available at https://github.com/ZhuJiwei111/SPACE.",
