Economic inequality is a global challenge, intensifying disparities in
education, healthcare, and social stability. Traditional systems like the U.S.
federal income tax reduce inequality but lack adaptability. Although models
like the Saez Optimal Taxation adjust dynamically, they fail to address
taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior. This study introduces TaxAgent,
a novel integration of large language models (LLMs) with agent-based modeling
(ABM) to design adaptive tax policies. In our macroeconomic simulation,
heterogeneous H-Agents (households) simulate real-world taxpayer behaviors
while the TaxAgent (government) utilizes LLMs to iteratively optimize tax
rates, balancing equity and productivity. Benchmarked against Saez Optimal
Taxation, U.S. federal income taxes, and free markets, TaxAgent achieves
superior equity-efficiency trade-offs. This research offers a novel taxation
solution and a scalable, data-driven framework for fiscal policy evaluation.","[{'text': 'Progressive taxation reduces inequality but lacks adaptability', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment':
