Here is the paper abstract:\nUnderstanding how feature representations evolve across layers in large\nlanguage models (LLMs) is key to improving their interpretability and\nrobustness. While recent studies have identified critical layers linked to\nspecific functions or behaviors, these efforts typically rely on data-dependent\nanalyses of fine-tuned models, limiting their use to post-hoc settings. In\ncontrast, we introduce a data-oblivious approach to identify intrinsic critical\nlayers in pre-fine-tuned LLMs by analyzing representation dynamics via Centered\nKernel Alignment(CKA). We show that layers with significant shifts in\nrepresentation space are also those most affected during fine-tuning--a pattern\nthat holds consistently across tasks for a given model. Our spectral analysis\nfurther reveals that these shifts are driven by changes in the top principal\ncomponents, which encode semantic transitions from rationales to conclusions.\nWe further apply these findings to two practical scenarios: efficient domain\nadaptation, where fine-tuning critical layers leads to greater loss reduction\ncompared to non-critical layers; and backdoor defense, where freezing them\nreduces attack success rates by up to 40%.",
