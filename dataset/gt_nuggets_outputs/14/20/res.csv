Conventional semi-supervised learning (SSL) ideally assumes that labeled and
unlabeled data share an identical class distribution, however in practice, this
assumption is easily violated, as unlabeled data often includes unknown class
data, i.e., outliers. The outliers are treated as noise, considerably degrading
the performance of SSL models. To address this drawback, we propose a novel
framework, Diversify and Conquer (DAC), to enhance SSL robustness in the
context of open-set semi-supervised learning. In particular, we note that
existing open-set SSL methods rely on prediction discrepancies between inliers
and outliers from a single model trained on labeled data. This approach can be
easily failed when the labeled data is insufficient, leading to performance
degradation that is worse than naive SSL that do not account for outliers. In
contrast, our approach exploits prediction disagreements among multiple models
that are differently biased towards the unlabeled distribution. By leveraging
the discrepancies arising from training on unlabeled data, our method enables
robust outlier detection even when the labeled data is underspecified. Our key
contribution is constructing a collection of differently biased models through
a single training process. By encouraging divergent heads to be differently
biased towards outliers while making consistent predictions for inliers, we
exploit the disagreement among these heads as a measure to identify unknown
concepts.
