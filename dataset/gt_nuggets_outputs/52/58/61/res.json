  "query": "Write a Related Works section for an academic paper given the paper's abstract. Here is the paper abstract:\nWith the growing abundance of repositories containing tabular data,\ndiscovering relevant tables for in-depth analysis remains a challenging task.\nExisting table discovery methods primarily retrieve desired tables based on a\nquery table or several vague keywords, leaving users to manually filter large\nresult sets. To address this limitation, we propose a new task: NL-conditional\ntable discovery (nlcTD), where users combine a query table with natural\nlanguage (NL) requirements to refine search results. To advance research in\nthis area, we present nlcTables, a comprehensive benchmark dataset comprising\n627 diverse queries spanning NL-only, union, join, and fuzzy conditions, 22,080\ncandidate tables, and 21,200 relevance annotations. Our evaluation of six\nstate-of-the-art table discovery methods on nlcTables reveals substantial\nperformance gaps, highlighting the need for advanced techniques to tackle this\nchallenging nlcTD scenario. The dataset, construction framework, and baseline\nimplementations are publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/SuDIS-ZJU/nlcTables to foster future research.",
