Despite differential privacy (DP) often being considered the de facto
standard for data privacy, its realization is vulnerable to unfaithful
execution of its mechanisms by servers, especially in distributed settings.
Specifically, servers may sample noise from incorrect distributions or generate
correlated noise while appearing to follow established protocols. This work
analyzes these malicious behaviors in a general differential privacy framework
within a distributed client-server-verifier setup. To address these adversarial
problems, we propose a novel definition called Verifiable Distributed
Differential Privacy (VDDP) by incorporating additional verification
mechanisms. We also explore the relationship between zero-knowledge proofs
(ZKP) and DP, demonstrating that while ZKPs are sufficient for achieving DP
under verifiability requirements, they are not necessary. Furthermore, we
develop two novel and efficient mechanisms that satisfy VDDP: (1) the
Verifiable Distributed Discrete Laplacian Mechanism (VDDLM), which offers up to
a $4 \times 10^5$x improvement in proof generation efficiency with only
0.1-0.2x error compared to the previous state-of-the-art verifiable
differentially private mechanism; (2) an improved solution to Verifiable
Randomized Response (VRR) under local DP, a special case of VDDP, achieving up
a reduction of up to 5000x in communication costs and the verifier's overhead.","[{'text': 'MPC-based DP mechanisms lack external verifiability of randomness and computation', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Prior work does not address external analyst verification in distributed DP', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'VDDP enables verifiable DP in client-server-verifier distributed settings', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'partial_support'}, {'text': 'VDDLM achieves 4x10^5x faster proofs with minimal error over prior art', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'not_support'}, {'text': 'Improved Verifiable Randomized Response reduces communication and verifier overhead by 5000x', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'not_support'}, {'text': 'ZKPs are sufficient but not necessary for verifiable DP', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'not_support'}, {'text': 'VDDP uniquely provides authenticity, correct computation, and verifiable randomness', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'partial_support'}, {'text': ""Comparison with prior work shows VDDP's broader verifiability and end-to-end DP"", 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'partial_support'}, {'text': 'Verifiable executions of DP mechanisms use cryptographic proofs for correctness', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'VFuzz and DPrio pioneered verifiable DP computation in database systems', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Recent work verifies correct noise sampling in DP: KCY21, STC+24, VDBM', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Secure randomness generation and DP via secure computation, including MPC', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'support'}]","[{'text': 'MPC-based DP mechanisms lack external verifiability of randomness and computation', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Prior work does not address external analyst verification in distributed DP', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Verifiable executions of DP mechanisms use cryptographic proofs for correctness', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'VFuzz and DPrio pioneered verifiable DP computation in database systems', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Recent work verifies correct noise sampling in DP: KCY21, STC+24, VDBM', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Secure randomness generation and DP via secure computation, including MPC', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'support'}]","[{'text': 'MPC-based DP mechanisms lack external verifiability of randomness and computation', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Prior work does not address external analyst verification in distributed DP', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'VDDP enables verifiable DP in client-server-verifier distributed settings', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'partial_support'}, {'text': 'VDDP uniquely provides authenticity, correct computation, and verifiable randomness', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'partial_support'}, {'text': ""Comparison with prior work shows VDDP's broader verifiability and end-to-end DP"", 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'partial_support'}, {'text': 'Verifiable executions of DP mechanisms use cryptographic proofs for correctness', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'VFuzz and DPrio pioneered verifiable DP computation in database systems', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Recent work verifies correct noise sampling in DP: KCY21, STC+24, VDBM', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Secure randomness generation and DP via secure computation, including MPC', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'support'}]","{'strict_vital_score': 0.25, 'strict_all_score': 0.5, 'vital_score': 0.4375, 'all_score': 0.625}"
