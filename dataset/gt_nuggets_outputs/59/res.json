Prior work\nhas identified a trade-off between ranking accuracy and item fairness. However,\nthe underlying mechanisms are still not fully understood. An analogy can be\ndrawn between re-ranking and the dynamics of economic transactions. The\naccuracy-fairness trade-off parallels the coupling of the commodity tax\ntransfer process. Fairness considerations in re-ranking, similar to a commodity\ntax on suppliers, ultimately translate into a cost passed on to consumers.\nAnalogously, item-side fairness constraints result in a decline in user-side\naccuracy. In economics, the extent to which commodity tax on the supplier (item\nfairness) transfers to commodity tax on users (accuracy loss) is formalized\nusing the notion of elasticity. The re-ranking fairness-accuracy trade-off is\nsimilarly governed by the elasticity of utility between item groups. This\ninsight underscores the limitations of current fair re-ranking evaluations,\nwhich often rely solely on a single fairness metric, hindering comprehensive\nassessment of fair re-ranking algorithms. Centered around the concept of\nelasticity, this work presents two significant contributions. We introduce the\nElastic Fairness Curve (EF-Curve) as an evaluation framework. This framework\nenables a comparative analysis of algorithm performance across different\nelasticity levels, facilitating the selection of the most suitable approach.\nFurthermore, we propose ElasticRank, a fair re-ranking algorithm that employs\nelasticity calculations to adjust inter-item distances within a curved space.\nExperiments on three widely used ranking datasets demonstrate its effectiveness\nand efficiency.",
