Fairness is an increasingly important factor in re-ranking tasks. Prior work
has identified a trade-off between ranking accuracy and item fairness. However,
the underlying mechanisms are still not fully understood. An analogy can be
drawn between re-ranking and the dynamics of economic transactions. The
accuracy-fairness trade-off parallels the coupling of the commodity tax
transfer process. Fairness considerations in re-ranking, similar to a commodity
tax on suppliers, ultimately translate into a cost passed on to consumers.
Analogously, item-side fairness constraints result in a decline in user-side
accuracy. In economics, the extent to which commodity tax on the supplier (item
fairness) transfers to commodity tax on users (accuracy loss) is formalized
using the notion of elasticity. The re-ranking fairness-accuracy trade-off is
similarly governed by the elasticity of utility between item groups. This
insight underscores the limitations of current fair re-ranking evaluations,
which often rely solely on a single fairness metric, hindering comprehensive
assessment of fair re-ranking algorithms. Centered around the concept of
elasticity, this work presents two significant contributions. We introduce the
Elastic Fairness Curve (EF-Curve) as an evaluation framework. This framework
enables a comparative analysis of algorithm performance across different
elasticity levels, facilitating the selection of the most suitable approach.
Furthermore, we propose ElasticRank, a fair re-ranking algorithm that employs
elasticity calculations to adjust inter-item distances within a curved space.
Experiments on three widely used ranking datasets demonstrate its effectiveness
and efficiency.","[{'text': 'Fair re-ranking research addresses trade-offs between accuracy and item fairness', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'User-oriented and
