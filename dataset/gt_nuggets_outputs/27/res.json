Here is the paper abstract:\nNatural language (NL)-driven table discovery identifies relevant tables from\nlarge table repositories based on NL queries. While current deep-learning-based\nmethods using the traditional dense vector search pipeline, i.e.,\nrepresentation-index-search, achieve remarkable accuracy, they face several\nlimitations that impede further performance improvements: (i) the errors\naccumulated during the table representation and indexing phases affect the\nsubsequent search accuracy; and (ii) insufficient query-table interaction\nhinders effective semantic alignment, impeding accuracy improvements. In this\npaper, we propose a novel framework Birdie, using a differentiable search\nindex. It unifies the indexing and search into a single encoder-decoder\nlanguage model, thus getting rid of error accumulations. Birdie first assigns\neach table a prefix-aware identifier and leverages a large language model-based\nquery generator to create synthetic queries for each table. It then encodes the\nmapping between synthetic queries/tables and their corresponding table\nidentifiers into the parameters of an encoder-decoder language model, enabling\ndeep query-table interactions. During search, the trained model directly\ngenerates table identifiers for a given query. To accommodate the continual\nindexing of dynamic tables, we introduce an index update strategy via parameter\nisolation, which mitigates the issue of catastrophic forgetting. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that Birdie outperforms state-of-the-art dense methods\nby 16.8% in accuracy, and reduces forgetting by over 90% compared to other\ncontinual learning approaches.",
