Event cameras capture scene changes asynchronously on a per-pixel basis,
enabling extremely high temporal resolution. However, this advantage comes at
the cost of high bandwidth, memory, and computational demands. To address this,
prior work has explored event downsampling, but most approaches rely on fixed
heuristics or threshold-based strategies, limiting their adaptability. Instead,
we propose a probabilistic framework, POLED, that models event importance
through an event-importance probability density function (ePDF), which can be
arbitrarily defined and adapted to different applications. Our approach
operates in a purely online setting, estimating event importance on-the-fly
from raw event streams, enabling scene-specific adaptation. Additionally, we
introduce zero-shot event downsampling, where downsampled events must remain
usable for models trained on the original event stream, without task-specific
adaptation. We design a contour-preserving ePDF that prioritizes structurally
important events and evaluate our method across four datasets and tasks--object
classification, image interpolation, surface normal estimation, and object
detection--demonstrating that intelligent sampling is crucial for maintaining
performance under event-budget constraints.","[{'text': 'Event cameras generate high-bandwidth, high-frequency asynchronous data', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Event downsampling reduces bandwidth, memory, and computational demands', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Most prior methods rely on fixed heuristics or task-specific optimizations', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Closest prior work: uniform sampling for CNN training, ignores event importance', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Early methods used spatial and temporal scaling for event downsampling', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Counting strategies with refractory periods improved event integration', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Biologically inspired methods use multi-layer sensory unit activation', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) enable neuromorphic event downsampling', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Adaptive compression includes dynamic Huffman encoding for bandwidth control', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Non-uniform spatial sampling via 3D grids for pre-processing', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Human perception studies compare filtering and SNN-based sparsification', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Prior evaluations focus mainly on classification tasks and metrics', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'support'}]","[{'text': 'Event cameras generate high-bandwidth, high-frequency asynchronous data', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Event downsampling reduces bandwidth, memory, and computational demands', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Most prior methods rely on fixed heuristics or task-specific optimizations', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Closest prior work: uniform sampling for CNN training, ignores event importance', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Early methods used spatial and temporal scaling for event downsampling', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Counting strategies with refractory periods improved event integration', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Biologically inspired methods use multi-layer sensory unit activation', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) enable neuromorphic event downsampling', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Adaptive compression includes dynamic Huffman encoding for bandwidth control', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Non-uniform spatial sampling via 3D grids for pre-processing', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Human perception studies compare filtering and SNN-based sparsification', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Prior evaluations focus mainly on classification tasks and metrics', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'support'}]","[{'text': 'Event cameras generate high-bandwidth, high-frequency asynchronous data', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Event downsampling reduces bandwidth, memory, and computational demands', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Most prior methods rely on fixed heuristics or task-specific optimizations', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Closest prior work: uniform sampling for CNN training, ignores event importance', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Early methods used spatial and temporal scaling for event downsampling', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Counting strategies with refractory periods improved event integration', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Biologically inspired methods use multi-layer sensory unit activation', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) enable neuromorphic event downsampling', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Adaptive compression includes dynamic Huffman encoding for bandwidth control', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Non-uniform spatial sampling via 3D grids for pre-processing', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Human perception studies compare filtering and SNN-based sparsification', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Prior evaluations focus mainly on classification tasks and metrics', 'importance': 'okay', 'assignment': 'support'}]","{'strict_vital_score': 1.0, 'strict_all_score': 1.0, 'vital_score': 1.0, 'all_score': 1.0}"
