  "query": "Write a Related Works section for an academic paper given the paper's abstract. Here is the paper abstract:\nEvent cameras capture scene changes asynchronously on a per-pixel basis,\nenabling extremely high temporal resolution. However, this advantage comes at\nthe cost of high bandwidth, memory, and computational demands. To address this,\nprior work has explored event downsampling, but most approaches rely on fixed\nheuristics or threshold-based strategies, limiting their adaptability. Instead,\nwe propose a probabilistic framework, POLED, that models event importance\nthrough an event-importance probability density function (ePDF), which can be\narbitrarily defined and adapted to different applications. Our approach\noperates in a purely online setting, estimating event importance on-the-fly\nfrom raw event streams, enabling scene-specific adaptation. Additionally, we\nintroduce zero-shot event downsampling, where downsampled events must remain\nusable for models trained on the original event stream, without task-specific\nadaptation. We design a contour-preserving ePDF that prioritizes structurally\nimportant events and evaluate our method across four datasets and tasks--object\nclassification, image interpolation, surface normal estimation, and object\ndetection--demonstrating that intelligent sampling is crucial for maintaining\nperformance under event-budget constraints.",
