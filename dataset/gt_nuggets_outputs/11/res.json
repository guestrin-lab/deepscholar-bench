Here is the paper abstract:\nAction coordination in human structure is indispensable for the spatial\nconstraints of 2D joints to recover 3D pose. Usually, action coordination is\nrepresented as a long-range dependence among body parts. However, there are two\nmain challenges in modeling long-range dependencies. First, joints should not\nonly be constrained by other individual joints but also be modulated by the\nbody parts. Second, existing methods make networks deeper to learn dependencies\nbetween non-linked parts. They introduce uncorrelated noise and increase the\nmodel size. In this paper, we utilize a pyramid structure to better learn\npotential long-range dependencies. It can capture the correlation across joints\nand groups, which complements the context of the human sub-structure. In an\neffective cross-scale way, it captures the pyramid-structured long-range\ndependence. Specifically, we propose a novel Pyramid Graph Attention (PGA)\nmodule to capture long-range cross-scale dependencies. It concatenates\ninformation from various scales into a compact sequence, and then computes the\ncorrelation between scales in parallel. Combining PGA with graph convolution\nmodules, we develop a Pyramid Graph Transformer (PGFormer) for 3D human pose\nestimation, which is a lightweight multi-scale transformer architecture. It\nencapsulates human sub-structures into self-attention by pooling. Extensive\nexperiments show that our approach achieves lower error and smaller model size\nthan state-of-the-art methods on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets. The code\nis available at https://github.com/MingjieWe/PGFormer.",
