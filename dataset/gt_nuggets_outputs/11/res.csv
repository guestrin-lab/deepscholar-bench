Action coordination in human structure is indispensable for the spatial
constraints of 2D joints to recover 3D pose. Usually, action coordination is
represented as a long-range dependence among body parts. However, there are two
main challenges in modeling long-range dependencies. First, joints should not
only be constrained by other individual joints but also be modulated by the
body parts. Second, existing methods make networks deeper to learn dependencies
between non-linked parts. They introduce uncorrelated noise and increase the
model size. In this paper, we utilize a pyramid structure to better learn
potential long-range dependencies. It can capture the correlation across joints
and groups, which complements the context of the human sub-structure. In an
effective cross-scale way, it captures the pyramid-structured long-range
dependence. Specifically, we propose a novel Pyramid Graph Attention (PGA)
module to capture long-range cross-scale dependencies. It concatenates
information from various scales into a compact sequence, and then computes the
correlation between scales in parallel. Combining PGA with graph convolution
modules, we develop a Pyramid Graph Transformer (PGFormer) for 3D human pose
estimation, which is a lightweight multi-scale transformer architecture. It
encapsulates human sub-structures into self-attention by pooling. Extensive
experiments show that our approach achieves lower error and smaller model size
than state-of-the-art methods on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets. The code
is available at https://github.com/MingjieWe/PGFormer.","[{'text': '3D human pose estimation infers 3D body coordinates from 2D images', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text':
