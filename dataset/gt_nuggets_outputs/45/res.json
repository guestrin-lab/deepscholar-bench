Here is the paper abstract:\nOpinion mining plays a vital role in analysing user feedback and extracting\ninsights from textual data. While most research focuses on sentiment polarity\n(e.g., positive, negative, neutral), fine-grained emotion classification in app\nreviews remains underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by identifying and\naddressing the challenges and limitations in fine-grained emotion analysis in\nthe context of app reviews. Our study adapts Plutchik's emotion taxonomy to app\nreviews by developing a structured annotation framework and dataset. Through an\niterative human annotation process, we define clear annotation guidelines and\ndocument key challenges in emotion classification. Additionally, we evaluate\nthe feasibility of automating emotion annotation using large language models,\nassessing their cost-effectiveness and agreement with human-labelled data. Our\nfindings reveal that while large language models significantly reduce manual\neffort and maintain substantial agreement with human annotators, full\nautomation remains challenging due to the complexity of emotional\ninterpretation. This work contributes to opinion mining by providing structured\nguidelines, an annotated dataset, and insights for developing automated\npipelines to capture the complexity of emotions in app reviews.",
