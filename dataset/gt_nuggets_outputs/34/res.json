Here is the paper abstract:\nFund allocation has been an increasingly important problem in the financial\ndomain. In reality, we aim to allocate the funds to buy certain assets within a\ncertain future period. Naive solutions such as prediction-only or\nPredict-then-Optimize approaches suffer from goal mismatch. Additionally, the\nintroduction of the SOTA time series forecasting model inevitably introduces\nadditional uncertainty in the predicted result. To solve both problems\nmentioned above, we introduce a Risk-aware Time-Series Predict-and-Allocate\n(RTS-PnO) framework, which holds no prior assumption on the forecasting models.\nSuch a framework contains three features: (i) end-to-end training with\nobjective alignment measurement, (ii) adaptive forecasting uncertainty\ncalibration, and (iii) agnostic towards forecasting models. The evaluation of\nRTS-PnO is conducted over both online and offline experiments. For offline\nexperiments, eight datasets from three categories of financial applications are\nused: Currency, Stock, and Cryptos. RTS-PnO consistently outperforms other\ncompetitive baselines. The online experiment is conducted on the Cross-Border\nPayment business at FiT, Tencent, and an 8.4\\% decrease in regret is witnessed\nwhen compared with the product-line approach. The code for the offline\nexperiment is available at https://github.com/fuyuanlyu/RTS-PnO.",
