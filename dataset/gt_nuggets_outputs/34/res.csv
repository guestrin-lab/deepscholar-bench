Fund allocation has been an increasingly important problem in the financial
domain. In reality, we aim to allocate the funds to buy certain assets within a
certain future period. Naive solutions such as prediction-only or
Predict-then-Optimize approaches suffer from goal mismatch. Additionally, the
introduction of the SOTA time series forecasting model inevitably introduces
additional uncertainty in the predicted result. To solve both problems
mentioned above, we introduce a Risk-aware Time-Series Predict-and-Allocate
(RTS-PnO) framework, which holds no prior assumption on the forecasting models.
Such a framework contains three features: (i) end-to-end training with
objective alignment measurement, (ii) adaptive forecasting uncertainty
calibration, and (iii) agnostic towards forecasting models. The evaluation of
RTS-PnO is conducted over both online and offline experiments. For offline
experiments, eight datasets from three categories of financial applications are
used: Currency, Stock, and Cryptos. RTS-PnO consistently outperforms other
competitive baselines. The online experiment is conducted on the Cross-Border
Payment business at FiT, Tencent, and an 8.4\% decrease in regret is witnessed
when compared with the product-line approach. The code for the offline
experiment is available at https://github.com/fuyuanlyu/RTS-PnO.","[{'text': 'Uncertainty quantification is lacking in most forecasting models', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'support'},
