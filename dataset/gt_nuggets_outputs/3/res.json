  "query": "Write a Related Works section for an academic paper given the paper's abstract. Here is the paper abstract:\nRecent advances in Text-to-Speech (TTS) have significantly improved speech\nnaturalness, increasing the demand for precise prosody control and\nmispronunciation correction. Existing approaches for prosody manipulation often\ndepend on specialized modules or additional training, limiting their capacity\nfor post-hoc adjustments. Similarly, traditional mispronunciation correction\nrelies on grapheme-to-phoneme dictionaries, making it less practical in\nlow-resource settings. We introduce Counterfactual Activation Editing, a\nmodel-agnostic method that manipulates internal representations in a\npre-trained TTS model to achieve post-hoc control of prosody and pronunciation.\nExperimental results show that our method effectively adjusts prosodic features\nand corrects mispronunciations while preserving synthesis quality. This opens\nthe door to inference-time refinement of TTS outputs without retraining,\nbridging the gap between pre-trained TTS models and editable speech synthesis.",
