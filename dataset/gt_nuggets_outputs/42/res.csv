Modern cloud-native applications increasingly utilise managed cloud services
and containerisation technologies, such as Kubernetes, to achieve rapid
time-to-market and scalable deployments. Organisations must consider various
factors, including cost implications when deciding on a hosting platform for
containerised applications as the usage grows. An emerging discipline called
FinOps combines financial management and cloud operations to optimise costs in
cloud-based applications. While prior research has explored system-level
optimisation strategies for cost and resource efficiency in containerized
systems, analysing network costs in Kubernetes clusters remains underexplored.
This paper investigates the network usage and cost implications of
containerised applications running on Kubernetes clusters. Using a methodology
that combines measurement analysis, experimentation, and cost modelling, we aim
to provide organisations with actionable insights into network cost
optimisation. Our findings highlight key considerations for analysing network
expenditures and evaluating the potential cost benefits of deploying
applications on cloud providers. Overall, this paper contributes to the
emerging FinOps discipline by addressing the financial and operational aspects
of managing network costs in cloud-native environments.","[{'text': 'Cloud providers offer cost tools but lack detailed network cost breakdowns', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'support'},
