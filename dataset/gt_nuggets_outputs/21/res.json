Here is the paper abstract:\nNeural rendering methods have gained significant attention for their ability\nto reconstruct 3D scenes from 2D images. The core idea is to take multiple\nviews as input and optimize the reconstructed scene by minimizing the\nuncertainty in geometry and appearance across the views. However, the\nreconstruction quality is limited by the number of input views. This limitation\nis further pronounced in complex and dynamic scenes, where certain angles of\nobjects are never seen. In this paper, we propose to use video frame\ninterpolation as the data augmentation method for neural rendering.\nFurthermore, we design a lightweight yet high-quality video frame interpolation\nmodel, PS4PRO (Pixel-to-pixel Supervision for Photorealistic Rendering and\nOptimization). PS4PRO is trained on diverse video datasets, implicitly modeling\ncamera movement as well as real-world 3D geometry. Our model performs as an\nimplicit world prior, enriching the photo supervision for 3D reconstruction. By\nleveraging the proposed method, we effectively augment existing datasets for\nneural rendering methods. Our experimental results indicate that our method\nimproves the reconstruction performance on both static and dynamic scenes.",
