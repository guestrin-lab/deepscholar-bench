  "query": "Write a Related Works section for an academic paper given the paper's abstract. Here is the paper abstract:\nServerless computing abstracts away server management, enabling automatic\nscaling, efficient resource utilization, and cost-effective pricing models.\nHowever, despite these advantages, it faces the significant challenge of\ncold-start latency, adversely impacting end-to-end performance. Our study shows\nthat many serverless functions initialize libraries that are rarely or never\nused under typical workloads, thus introducing unnecessary overhead. Although\nexisting static analysis techniques can identify unreachable libraries, they\nfail to address workload-dependent inefficiencies, resulting in limited\nperformance improvements. To overcome these limitations, we present SLIMSTART,\na profile-guided optimization tool designed to identify and mitigate\ninefficient library usage patterns in serverless applications. By leveraging\nstatistical sampling and call-path profiling, SLIMSTART collects runtime\nlibrary usage data, generates detailed optimization reports, and applies\nautomated code transformations to reduce cold-start overhead. Furthermore,\nSLIMSTART integrates seamlessly into CI/CD pipelines, enabling adaptive\nmonitoring and continuous optimizations tailored to evolving workloads. Through\nextensive evaluation across three benchmark suites and four real-world\nserverless applications, SLIMSTART achieves up to a 2.30X speedup in\ninitialization latency, a 2.26X improvement in end-to-end latency, and a 1.51X\nreduction in memory usage, demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing\ncold-start inefficiencies and optimizing resource utilization.",
