Here is the paper abstract:\nMulti-Domain Recommendation (MDR) achieves the desirable recommendation\nperformance by effectively utilizing the transfer information across different\ndomains. Despite the great success, most existing MDR methods adopt a single\nstructure to transfer complex domain-shared knowledge. However, the beneficial\ntransferring information should vary across different domains. When there is\nknowledge conflict between domains or a domain is of poor quality,\nunselectively leveraging information from all domains will lead to a serious\nNegative Transfer Problem (NTP). Therefore, how to effectively model the\ncomplex transfer relationships between domains to avoid NTP is still a\ndirection worth exploring. To address these issues, we propose a simple and\ndynamic Similar Domain Selection Principle (SDSP) for multi-domain\nrecommendation in this paper. SDSP presents the initial exploration of\nselecting suitable domain knowledge for each domain to alleviate NTP.\nSpecifically, we propose a novel prototype-based domain distance measure to\neffectively model the complexity relationship between domains. Thereafter, the\nproposed SDSP can dynamically find similar domains for each domain based on the\nsupervised signals of the domain metrics and the unsupervised distance measure\nfrom the learned domain prototype. We emphasize that SDSP is a lightweight\nmethod that can be incorporated with existing MDR methods for better\nperformance while not introducing excessive time overheads. To the best of our\nknowledge, it is the first solution that can explicitly measure domain-level\ngaps and dynamically select appropriate domains in the MDR field. Extensive\nexperiments on three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed\nmethod.",
