Here is the paper abstract:\nIntegrating knowledge graphs (KGs) to enhance the reasoning capabilities of\nlarge language models (LLMs) is an emerging research challenge in claim\nverification. While KGs provide structured, semantically rich representations\nwell-suited for reasoning, most existing verification methods rely on\nunstructured text corpora, limiting their ability to effectively leverage KGs.\nAdditionally, despite possessing strong reasoning abilities, modern LLMs\nstruggle with multi-step modular pipelines and reasoning over KGs without\nadaptation. To address these challenges, we propose ClaimPKG, an end-to-end\nframework that seamlessly integrates LLM reasoning with structured knowledge\nfrom KGs. Specifically, the main idea of ClaimPKG is to employ a lightweight,\nspecialized LLM to represent the input claim as pseudo-subgraphs, guiding a\ndedicated subgraph retrieval module to identify relevant KG subgraphs. These\nretrieved subgraphs are then processed by a general-purpose LLM to produce the\nfinal verdict and justification. Extensive experiments on the FactKG dataset\ndemonstrate that ClaimPKG achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming\nstrong baselines in this research field by 9%-12% accuracy points across\nmultiple categories. Furthermore, ClaimPKG exhibits zero-shot generalizability\nto unstructured datasets such as HoVer and FEVEROUS, effectively combining\nstructured knowledge from KGs with LLM reasoning across various LLM backbones.",
