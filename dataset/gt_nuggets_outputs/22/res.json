  "query": "Write a Related Works section for an academic paper given the paper's abstract. Here is the paper abstract:\nUnsupervised domain adaptation for semantic segmentation (UDA-SS) aims to\ntransfer knowledge from labeled source data to unlabeled target data. However,\ntraditional UDA-SS methods assume that category settings between source and\ntarget domains are known, which is unrealistic in real-world scenarios. This\nleads to performance degradation if private classes exist. To address this\nlimitation, we propose Universal Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation\n(UniDA-SS), achieving robust adaptation even without prior knowledge of\ncategory settings. We define the problem in the UniDA-SS scenario as low\nconfidence scores of common classes in the target domain, which leads to\nconfusion with private classes. To solve this problem, we propose UniMAP:\nUniDA-SS with Image Matching and Prototype-based Distinction, a novel framework\ncomposed of two key components. First, Domain-Specific Prototype-based\nDistinction (DSPD) divides each class into two domain-specific prototypes,\nenabling finer separation of domain-specific features and enhancing the\nidentification of common classes across domains. Second, Target-based Image\nMatching (TIM) selects a source image containing the most common-class pixels\nbased on the target pseudo-label and pairs it in a batch to promote effective\nlearning of common classes. We also introduce a new UniDA-SS benchmark and\ndemonstrate through various experiments that UniMAP significantly outperforms\nbaselines. The code is available at\n\\href{https://github.com/KU-VGI/UniMAP}{this https URL}.",
