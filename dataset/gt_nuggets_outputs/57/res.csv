Generative retrieval (GR) has emerged as a promising paradigm in information
retrieval (IR). However, most existing GR models are developed and evaluated
using a static document collection, and their performance in dynamic corpora
where document collections evolve continuously is rarely studied. In this
paper, we first reproduce and systematically evaluate various representative GR
approaches over dynamic corpora. Through extensive experiments, we reveal that
existing GR models with \textit{text-based} docids show superior generalization
to unseen documents. We observe that the more fine-grained the docid design in
the GR model, the better its performance over dynamic corpora, surpassing BM25
and even being comparable to dense retrieval methods. While GR models with
\textit{numeric-based} docids show high efficiency, their performance drops
significantly over dynamic corpora. Furthermore, our experiments find that the
underperformance of numeric-based docids is partly due to their excessive
tendency toward the initial document set, which likely results from overfitting
on the training set. We then conduct an in-depth analysis of the
best-performing GR methods. We identify three critical advantages of text-based
docids in dynamic corpora: (i) Semantic alignment with language models'
pretrained knowledge, (ii) Fine-grained docid design, and (iii) High lexical
diversity. Building on these insights, we finally propose a novel multi-docid
design that leverages both the efficiency of numeric-based docids and the
effectiveness of text-based docids, achieving improved performance in dynamic
corpus without requiring additional retraining. Our work offers empirical
evidence for advancing GR methods over dynamic corpora and paves the way for
developing more generalized yet efficient GR models in real-world search
engines.","[{'text': 'Generative retrieval (GR) reformulates retrieval as a text generation task', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'GR methods use either numeric-based or
