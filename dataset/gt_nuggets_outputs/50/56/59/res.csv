Cross-domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) aims to extract the preference
from the user's historical interactions across various domains. Despite some
progress in CDSR, two problems set the barrier for further advancements, i.e.,
overlap dilemma and transition complexity. The former means existing CDSR
methods severely rely on users who own interactions on all domains to learn
cross-domain item relationships, compromising the practicability. The latter
refers to the difficulties in learning the complex transition patterns from the
mixed behavior sequences. With powerful representation and reasoning abilities,
Large Language Models (LLMs) are promising to address these two problems by
bridging the items and capturing the user's preferences from a semantic view.
Therefore, we propose an LLMs Enhanced Cross-domain Sequential Recommendation
model (LLM4CDSR). To obtain the semantic item relationships, we first propose
an LLM-based unified representation module to represent items. Then, a
trainable adapter with contrastive regularization is designed to adapt the CDSR
task. Besides, a hierarchical LLMs profiling module is designed to summarize
user cross-domain preferences. Finally, these two modules are integrated into
the proposed tri-thread framework to derive recommendations. We have conducted
extensive experiments on three public cross-domain datasets, validating the
effectiveness of LLM4CDSR. We have released the code online.","[{'text': 'CDSR combines cross-domain and sequential recommendation strengths', 'importance': 'vital', 'assignment': 'support'}, {'text': 'Key CDSR challenge:
