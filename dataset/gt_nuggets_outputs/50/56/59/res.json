Here is the paper abstract:\nCross-domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) aims to extract the preference\nfrom the user's historical interactions across various domains. Despite some\nprogress in CDSR, two problems set the barrier for further advancements, i.e.,\noverlap dilemma and transition complexity. The former means existing CDSR\nmethods severely rely on users who own interactions on all domains to learn\ncross-domain item relationships, compromising the practicability. The latter\nrefers to the difficulties in learning the complex transition patterns from the\nmixed behavior sequences. With powerful representation and reasoning abilities,\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) are promising to address these two problems by\nbridging the items and capturing the user's preferences from a semantic view.\nTherefore, we propose an LLMs Enhanced Cross-domain Sequential Recommendation\nmodel (LLM4CDSR). To obtain the semantic item relationships, we first propose\nan LLM-based unified representation module to represent items. Then, a\ntrainable adapter with contrastive regularization is designed to adapt the CDSR\ntask. Besides, a hierarchical LLMs profiling module is designed to summarize\nuser cross-domain preferences. Finally, these two modules are integrated into\nthe proposed tri-thread framework to derive recommendations. We have conducted\nextensive experiments on three public cross-domain datasets, validating the\neffectiveness of LLM4CDSR. We have released the code online.",
