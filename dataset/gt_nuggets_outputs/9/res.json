Here is the paper abstract:\nQuantitative susceptibility maps from magnetic resonance images can provide\nboth prognostic and diagnostic information in multiple sclerosis, a\nneurodegenerative disease characterized by the formation of lesions in white\nmatter brain tissue. In particular, susceptibility maps provide adequate\ncontrast to distinguish between \"rim\" lesions, surrounded by deposited\nparamagnetic iron, and \"non-rim\" lesion types. These paramagnetic rim lesions\n(PRLs) are an emerging biomarker in multiple sclerosis. Much effort has been\ndevoted to both detection and segmentation of such lesions to monitor\nlongitudinal change. As paramagnetic rim lesions are rare, addressing this\nproblem requires confronting the class imbalance between rim and non-rim\nlesions. We produce synthetic quantitative susceptibility maps of paramagnetic\nrim lesions and show that inclusion of such synthetic data improves classifier\nperformance and provide a multi-channel extension to generate accompanying\ncontrasts and probabilistic segmentation maps. We exploit the projection\ncapability of our trained generative network to demonstrate a novel denoising\napproach that allows us to train on ambiguous rim cases and substantially\nincrease the minority class. We show that both synthetic lesion synthesis and\nour proposed rim lesion label denoising method best approximate the unseen rim\nlesion distribution and improve detection in a clinically interpretable manner.\nWe release our code and generated data at https://github.com/agr78/PRLx-GAN\nupon publication.",
