Here is the paper abstract:\nGraph convolutional networks have recently gained prominence in collaborative\nfiltering (CF) for recommendations. However, we identify potential bottlenecks\nin two foundational components. First, the embedding layer leads to a latent\nspace with limited capacity, overlooking locally observed but potentially\nvaluable preference patterns. Also, the widely-used neighborhood aggregation is\nlimited in its ability to leverage diverse preference patterns in a\nfine-grained manner. Building on spectral graph theory, we reveal that these\nlimitations stem from graph filtering with a cut-off in the frequency spectrum\nand a restricted linear form. To address these issues, we introduce ChebyCF, a\nCF framework based on graph spectral filtering. Instead of a learned embedding,\nit takes a user's raw interaction history to utilize the full spectrum of\nsignals contained in it. Also, it adopts Chebyshev interpolation to effectively\napproximate a flexible non-linear graph filter, and further enhances it by\nusing an additional ideal pass filter and degree-based normalization. Through\nextensive experiments, we verify that ChebyCF overcomes the aforementioned\nbottlenecks and achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple\nbenchmarks and reasonably fast inference. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/chanwoo0806/ChebyCF.",
