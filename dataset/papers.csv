2506.02838v1,TaxAgent: How Large Language Model Designs Fiscal Policy,"Jizhou Wang, Xiaodan Fang, Lei Huang, Yongfeng Huang","Economic inequality is a global challenge, intensifying disparities in
education, healthcare, and social stability. Traditional systems like the U.S.
federal income tax reduce inequality but lack adaptability. Although models
like the Saez Optimal Taxation adjust dynamically, they fail to address
taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior. This study introduces TaxAgent,
a novel integration of large language models (LLMs) with agent-based modeling
(ABM) to design adaptive tax policies. In our macroeconomic simulation,
heterogeneous H-Agents (households) simulate real-world taxpayer behaviors
while the TaxAgent (government) utilizes LLMs to iteratively optimize tax
rates, balancing equity and productivity. Benchmarked against Saez Optimal
Taxation, U.S. federal income taxes, and free markets, TaxAgent achieves
superior equity-efficiency trade-offs. This research offers a novel taxation
solution and a scalable, data-driven framework for fiscal policy evaluation.","cs.AI, econ.GN, q-fin.EC, I.2.11, I.6.5, J.4",2025-06-03T13:06:19+00:00,2025-06-03T13:06:19+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02838v1

  at a Large Cloud Provider","Jiahao Wang, Jinbo Han, Xingda Wei, Sijie Shen, Dingyan Zhang, Chenguang Fang, Rong Chen, Wenyuan Yu, Haibo Chen","Serving large language models (LLMs) is important for cloud providers, and
caching intermediate results (KV\$) after processing each request substantially
improves serving throughput and latency. However, there is limited
understanding of how LLM serving benefits from KV\$ caching, where system
design decisions like cache eviction policies are highly workload-dependent. In
this paper, we present the first systematic characterization of the KV\$
workload patterns from one of the leading LLM service providers. We draw
observations that were not covered by previous studies focusing on synthetic
workloads, including: KV\$ reuses are skewed across requests, where reuses
between single-turn requests are equally important as multi-turn requests; the
reuse time and probability are diverse considering all requests, but for a
specific request category, the pattern tends to be predictable; and the overall
cache size required for an ideal cache hit ratio is moderate. Based on the
characterization, we further propose a workload-aware cache eviction policy
that improves the serving performance under real-world traces, especially with
limited cache capacity.","cs.DC, cs.AI",2025-06-03T08:51:38+00:00,2025-06-03T08:51:38+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02634v1

naturalness, increasing the demand for precise prosody control and
mispronunciation correction. Existing approaches for prosody manipulation often
depend on specialized modules or additional training, limiting their capacity

relies on grapheme-to-phoneme dictionaries, making it less practical in
low-resource settings. We introduce Counterfactual Activation Editing, a
model-agnostic method that manipulates internal representations in a
pre-trained TTS model to achieve post-hoc control of prosody and pronunciation.
Experimental results show that our method effectively adjusts prosodic features

from large annotated corpora. Existing approaches detect noisy annotations by
ranking local perplexities, presuming that noisy samples yield higher
perplexities than their clean counterparts. However, this assumption breaks
down when the noise ratio is high and many demonstrations are flawed. We
reexamine the perplexity based paradigm for text generation under noisy
annotations, highlighting two sources of bias in perplexity: the annotation
itself and the domain specific knowledge inherent in large language models
(LLMs). To overcome these biases, we introduce a dual debiasing framework that
uses synthesized neighbors to explicitly correct perplexity estimates, yielding
a robust Sample Cleanliness Score. This metric uncovers absolute sample
cleanliness regardless of the overall corpus noise level. Extensive experiments
demonstrate our method's superior noise detection capabilities and show that
its final ICL performance is comparable to that of a fully clean demonstration
corpus. Moreover, our approach remains robust even when noise ratios are
extremely high.","cs.CL, cs.AI, I.2.7",2025-05-31T06:44:48+00:00,2025-05-31T06:44:48+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00418v1

  based on Guided Space Transformation","Yingchaojie Feng, Yiqun Sun, Yandong Sun, Minfeng Zhu, Qiang Huang, Anthony K. H. Tung, Wei Chen","In this work, we investigate an important task named instruction-following
text embedding, which generates dynamic text embeddings that adapt to user
instructions, highlighting specific attributes of text. Despite recent
advancements, existing approaches suffer from significant computational
overhead, as they require re-encoding the entire corpus for each new
instruction. To address this challenge, we propose GSTransform, a novel
instruction-following text embedding framework based on Guided Space
Transformation. Our key observation is that instruction-relevant information is
inherently encoded in generic embeddings but remains underutilized. Instead of
repeatedly encoding the corpus for each instruction, GSTransform is a
lightweight transformation mechanism that adapts pre-computed embeddings in
real time to align with user instructions, guided by a small amount of text
data with instruction-focused label annotation. We conduct extensive
experiments on three instruction-awareness downstream tasks across nine
real-world datasets, demonstrating that GSTransform improves
instruction-following text embedding quality over state-of-the-art methods

thematic coherence, a task that remains challenging for existing LLMs. We
introduce NexusSum, a multi-agent LLM framework for narrative summarization

method establishes a new state-of-the-art in narrative summarization, achieving
up to a 30.0% improvement in BERTScore (F1) across books, movies, and TV

activation space, yet identifying these behaviors remains a significant
challenge. Existing methods often rely on predefined refusal templates
detectable in output tokens or require manual analysis. We introduce
\textbf{COSMIC} (Cosine Similarity Metrics for Inversion of Concepts), an
automated framework for direction selection that identifies viable steering
directions and target layers using cosine similarity - entirely independent of
model outputs. COSMIC achieves steering performance comparable to prior methods
without requiring assumptions about a model's refusal behavior, such as the
presence of specific refusal tokens. It reliably identifies refusal directions
in adversarial settings and weakly aligned models, and is capable of steering
such models toward safer behavior with minimal increase in false refusals,

  LLMs","Yinong Oliver Wang, Nivedha Sivakumar, Falaah Arif Khan, Rin Metcalf Susa, Adam Golinski, Natalie Mackraz, Barry-John Theobald, Luca Zappella, Nicholas Apostoloff","The recent rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) highlights the
critical need for benchmarking their fairness. Conventional fairness metrics,
which focus on discrete accuracy-based evaluations (i.e., prediction
correctness), fail to capture the implicit impact of model uncertainty (e.g.,
higher model confidence about one group over another despite similar accuracy).
To address this limitation, we propose an uncertainty-aware fairness metric,
UCerF, to enable a fine-grained evaluation of model fairness that is more
reflective of the internal bias in model decisions compared to conventional
fairness measures. Furthermore, observing data size, diversity, and clarity
issues in current datasets, we introduce a new gender-occupation fairness
evaluation dataset with 31,756 samples for co-reference resolution, offering a
more diverse and suitable dataset for evaluating modern LLMs. We establish a
benchmark, using our metric and dataset, and apply it to evaluate the behavior
of ten open-source LLMs. For example, Mistral-7B exhibits suboptimal fairness
due to high confidence in incorrect predictions, a detail overlooked by
Equalized Odds but captured by UCerF. Overall, our proposed LLM benchmark,
which evaluates fairness with uncertainty awareness, paves the way for
developing more transparent and accountable AI systems.","cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.LG",2025-05-29T20:45:18+00:00,2025-05-29T20:45:18+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23996v1

  Multiple Sclerosis","Alexandra G. Roberts, Ha M. Luu, Mert Şişman, Alexey V. Dimov, Ceren Tozlu, Ilhami Kovanlikaya, Susan A. Gauthier, Thanh D. Nguyen, Yi Wang","Quantitative susceptibility maps from magnetic resonance images can provide
both prognostic and diagnostic information in multiple sclerosis, a
neurodegenerative disease characterized by the formation of lesions in white
matter brain tissue. In particular, susceptibility maps provide adequate
contrast to distinguish between ""rim"" lesions, surrounded by deposited
paramagnetic iron, and ""non-rim"" lesion types. These paramagnetic rim lesions
(PRLs) are an emerging biomarker in multiple sclerosis. Much effort has been
devoted to both detection and segmentation of such lesions to monitor
longitudinal change. As paramagnetic rim lesions are rare, addressing this
problem requires confronting the class imbalance between rim and non-rim
lesions. We produce synthetic quantitative susceptibility maps of paramagnetic
rim lesions and show that inclusion of such synthetic data improves classifier
performance and provide a multi-channel extension to generate accompanying
contrasts and probabilistic segmentation maps. We exploit the projection
capability of our trained generative network to demonstrate a novel denoising
approach that allows us to train on ambiguous rim cases and substantially
increase the minority class. We show that both synthetic lesion synthesis and
our proposed rim lesion label denoising method best approximate the unseen rim
lesion distribution and improve detection in a clinically interpretable manner.

2505.22757v1,Pre-Training Curriculum for Multi-Token Prediction in Language Models,"Ansar Aynetdinov, Alan Akbik","Multi-token prediction (MTP) is a recently proposed pre-training objective
for language models. Rather than predicting only the next token (NTP), MTP
predicts the next $k$ tokens at each prediction step, using multiple prediction
heads. MTP has shown promise in improving downstream performance, inference
speed, and training efficiency, particularly for large models. However, prior
work has shown that smaller language models (SLMs) struggle with the MTP
objective. To address this, we propose a curriculum learning strategy for MTP
training, exploring two variants: a forward curriculum, which gradually
increases the complexity of the pre-training objective from NTP to MTP, and a
reverse curriculum, which does the opposite. Our experiments show that the
forward curriculum enables SLMs to better leverage the MTP objective during
pre-training, improving downstream NTP performance and generative output
quality, while retaining the benefits of self-speculative decoding. The reverse
curriculum achieves stronger NTP performance and output quality, but fails to
provide any self-speculative decoding benefits.","cs.CL, cs.AI",2025-05-28T18:19:18+00:00,2025-05-28T18:19:18+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22757v1
2506.02853v1,"Learning Pyramid-structured Long-range Dependencies for 3D Human Pose
  Estimation","Mingjie Wei, Xuemei Xie, Yutong Zhong, Guangming Shi","Action coordination in human structure is indispensable for the spatial
constraints of 2D joints to recover 3D pose. Usually, action coordination is
represented as a long-range dependence among body parts. However, there are two
main challenges in modeling long-range dependencies. First, joints should not
only be constrained by other individual joints but also be modulated by the
body parts. Second, existing methods make networks deeper to learn dependencies
between non-linked parts. They introduce uncorrelated noise and increase the
model size. In this paper, we utilize a pyramid structure to better learn
potential long-range dependencies. It can capture the correlation across joints
and groups, which complements the context of the human sub-structure. In an
effective cross-scale way, it captures the pyramid-structured long-range
dependence. Specifically, we propose a novel Pyramid Graph Attention (PGA)
module to capture long-range cross-scale dependencies. It concatenates
information from various scales into a compact sequence, and then computes the
correlation between scales in parallel. Combining PGA with graph convolution
modules, we develop a Pyramid Graph Transformer (PGFormer) for 3D human pose
estimation, which is a lightweight multi-scale transformer architecture. It
encapsulates human sub-structures into self-attention by pooling. Extensive

enabling extremely high temporal resolution. However, this advantage comes at
the cost of high bandwidth, memory, and computational demands. To address this,
prior work has explored event downsampling, but most approaches rely on fixed
heuristics or threshold-based strategies, limiting their adaptability. Instead,
we propose a probabilistic framework, POLED, that models event importance
through an event-importance probability density function (ePDF), which can be
arbitrarily defined and adapted to different applications. Our approach
operates in a purely online setting, estimating event importance on-the-fly
from raw event streams, enabling scene-specific adaptation. Additionally, we
introduce zero-shot event downsampling, where downsampled events must remain
usable for models trained on the original event stream, without task-specific
adaptation. We design a contour-preserving ePDF that prioritizes structurally
important events and evaluate our method across four datasets and tasks--object
classification, image interpolation, surface normal estimation, and object
detection--demonstrating that intelligent sampling is crucial for maintaining
performance under event-budget constraints.","cs.CV, cs.ET",2025-06-03T07:33:11+00:00,2025-06-03T07:33:11+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02547v1

the performance of SSL models. To address this drawback, we propose a novel
framework, Diversify and Conquer (DAC), to enhance SSL robustness in the

easily failed when the labeled data is insufficient, leading to performance
degradation that is worse than naive SSL that do not account for outliers. In

the discrepancies arising from training on unlabeled data, our method enables
robust outlier detection even when the labeled data is underspecified. Our key
contribution is constructing a collection of differently biased models through

approaches, a class of iterative algorithms where regularization is implicitly
performed by an off-the-shelf deep denoiser, are flexible for varying
compression ratios (CRs) but are limited in reconstruction accuracy and speed.
Conversely, unrolling approaches, a class of multi-stage neural networks where
a truncated iterative optimization process is transformed into an end-to-end
trainable network, typically achieve better accuracy with faster inference but
require fine-tuning or even retraining when CR changes. In this paper, we
address the challenge of integrating the strengths of both classes of solvers.
To this end, we design an efficient deep image restorer (DIR) for the unrolling
of HQS (half quadratic splitting) and ADMM (alternating direction method of
multipliers). More importantly, a general proximal trajectory (PT) loss
function is proposed to train HQS/ADMM-unrolling networks such that learned DIR
approximates the proximal operator of an ideal explicit restoration
regularizer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, the resulting proximal
unrolling networks can not only flexibly handle varying CRs with a single model

Furthermore, we design a lightweight yet high-quality video frame interpolation

Distinction (DSPD) divides each class into two domain-specific prototypes,
enabling finer separation of domain-specific features and enhancing the

deep query-table interactions. During search, the trained model directly

testing is a prominent technique for detecting isolation bugs, by checking
whether histories of database transactions adhere to a prescribed isolation
level.
  Testing databases on realistic workloads of large size requires isolation

be testable in polynomial time, which has propelled the scalability of testing
tools. However, existing testers have a large polynomial complexity,
restricting testing to workloads of only moderate size, which is not typical of
large-scale databases.
  In this work, we develop AWDIT, a highly-efficient and provably optimal

sessions, AWDIT tests whether H satisfies the most common weak isolation levels
of Read Committed (RC), Read Atomic (RA), and Causal Consistency (CC) in time
$O(n^{3/2})$, $O(n^{3/2})$, and $O(n \cdot k)$, respectively, improving

de novo genome assembly through near-memory processing (NMP). Our channel-level
NMP architecture addresses memory bottlenecks while providing sufficient
scratchpad space for processing elements. Customized processing elements
maximize parallelism while efficiently handling large data structures that are
both dynamic and interdependent. Software optimizations include customized
batch processing to reduce the memory footprint and hybrid CPU-NMP processing
to address hardware underutilization caused by irregular data patterns.
  NMP-PaK conducts the same genome assembly while incurring a 14X smaller

privacy-preserving and verifiable computing. ZKPs enable a proving party to
prove the truth of a statement to a verifying party without revealing anything

the computational complexity of the proving process. Recent works have
accelerated the key primitives of state-of-the-art ZKP protocols on GPU and

systems. In particular, one challenging problem in this space is cross-domain
sequential recommendation (CDSR), which aims to predict future behaviors given
user interactions across multiple domains. Existing CDSR frameworks are mostly
built on the self-attention transformer and seek to improve by explicitly
injecting additional domain-specific components (e.g. domain-aware module
blocks). While these additional components help, we argue they overlook the
core self-attention module already present in the transformer, a naturally
powerful tool to learn correlations among behaviors. In this work, we aim to
improve the CDSR performance for simple models from a novel perspective of
enhancing the self-attention. Specifically, we introduce a Pareto-optimal
self-attention and formulate the cross-domain learning as a multi-objective
problem, where we optimize the recommendation task while dynamically minimizing
the cross-domain attention scores. Our approach automates knowledge transfer in
CDSR (dubbed as AutoCDSR) -- it not only mitigates negative transfer but also
encourages complementary knowledge exchange among auxiliary domains. Based on
the idea, we further introduce AutoCDSR+, a more performant variant with slight
additional cost. Our proposal is easy to implement and works as a plug-and-play
module that can be incorporated into existing transformer-based recommenders.
Besides flexibility, it is practical to deploy because it brings little extra
computational overheads without heavy hyper-parameter tuning. AutoCDSR on

performance by effectively utilizing the transfer information across different

structure to transfer complex domain-shared knowledge. However, the beneficial
transferring information should vary across different domains. When there is
knowledge conflict between domains or a domain is of poor quality,
unselectively leveraging information from all domains will lead to a serious
Negative Transfer Problem (NTP). Therefore, how to effectively model the
complex transfer relationships between domains to avoid NTP is still a
direction worth exploring. To address these issues, we propose a simple and
dynamic Similar Domain Selection Principle (SDSP) for multi-domain
recommendation in this paper. SDSP presents the initial exploration of
selecting suitable domain knowledge for each domain to alleviate NTP.
Specifically, we propose a novel prototype-based domain distance measure to
effectively model the complexity relationship between domains. Thereafter, the
proposed SDSP can dynamically find similar domains for each domain based on the
supervised signals of the domain metrics and the unsupervised distance measure
from the learned domain prototype. We emphasize that SDSP is a lightweight
method that can be incorporated with existing MDR methods for better

  Federated approaches to ranking of search results have recently garnered
attention to address users privacy concerns. In FOLTR, privacy is safeguarded
by collaboratively training ranking models across decentralized data sources,
preserving individual user data while optimizing search results based on
implicit feedback, such as clicks.
  Recent legislation introduced across numerous countries is establishing the

their true preferences, frequent user involvement can lead to a degraded user
experience.
  To address this problem, we propose a generative reward model based simulated
user, named GRSU, for automatic interaction with CRSs. The simulated user
provides feedback to the items recommended by CRSs, enabling them to better
capture intricate user preferences through multi-turn interaction. Inspired by
generative reward models, we design two types of feedback actions for the

feedback, and attribute-based item critique, which provides fine-grained
feedback. To ensure seamless integration, these feedback actions are unified
into an instruction-based format, allowing the development of a unified
simulated user via instruction tuning on synthesized data. With this simulated
user, automatic multi-turn interaction with CRSs can be effectively conducted.
Furthermore, to strike a balance between effectiveness and efficiency, we draw
inspiration from the paradigm of reward-guided search in complex reasoning

approaches over dynamic corpora. Through extensive experiments, we reveal that
existing GR models with \textit{text-based} docids show superior generalization
to unseen documents. We observe that the more fine-grained the docid design in
the GR model, the better its performance over dynamic corpora, surpassing BM25

underperformance of numeric-based docids is partly due to their excessive

  Discovery","Lingxi Cui, Huan Li, Ke Chen, Lidan Shou, Gang Chen","With the growing abundance of repositories containing tabular data,
discovering relevant tables for in-depth analysis remains a challenging task.
Existing table discovery methods primarily retrieve desired tables based on a
query table or several vague keywords, leaving users to manually filter large
result sets. To address this limitation, we propose a new task: NL-conditional
table discovery (nlcTD), where users combine a query table with natural
language (NL) requirements to refine search results. To advance research in
this area, we present nlcTables, a comprehensive benchmark dataset comprising
627 diverse queries spanning NL-only, union, join, and fuzzy conditions, 22,080
candidate tables, and 21,200 relevance annotations. Our evaluation of six
state-of-the-art table discovery methods on nlcTables reveals substantial
performance gaps, highlighting the need for advanced techniques to tackle this
challenging nlcTD scenario. The dataset, construction framework, and baseline
implementations are publicly available at

  Elasticity in Economics","Chen Xu, Jujia Zhao, Wenjie Wang, Liang Pang, Jun Xu, Tat-Seng Chua, Maarten de Rijke","Fairness is an increasingly important factor in re-ranking tasks. Prior work
has identified a trade-off between ranking accuracy and item fairness. However,
the underlying mechanisms are still not fully understood. An analogy can be
drawn between re-ranking and the dynamics of economic transactions. The
accuracy-fairness trade-off parallels the coupling of the commodity tax
transfer process. Fairness considerations in re-ranking, similar to a commodity
tax on suppliers, ultimately translate into a cost passed on to consumers.
Analogously, item-side fairness constraints result in a decline in user-side
accuracy. In economics, the extent to which commodity tax on the supplier (item
fairness) transfers to commodity tax on users (accuracy loss) is formalized
using the notion of elasticity. The re-ranking fairness-accuracy trade-off is
similarly governed by the elasticity of utility between item groups. This
insight underscores the limitations of current fair re-ranking evaluations,
which often rely solely on a single fairness metric, hindering comprehensive
assessment of fair re-ranking algorithms. Centered around the concept of
elasticity, this work presents two significant contributions. We introduce the
Elastic Fairness Curve (EF-Curve) as an evaluation framework. This framework
enables a comparative analysis of algorithm performance across different
elasticity levels, facilitating the selection of the most suitable approach.
Furthermore, we propose ElasticRank, a fair re-ranking algorithm that employs
elasticity calculations to adjust inter-item distances within a curved space.
Experiments on three widely used ranking datasets demonstrate its effectiveness

  Systems","Yimeng Bai, Shunyu Zhang, Yang Zhang, Hu Liu, Wentian Bao, Enyun Yu, Fuli Feng, Wenwu Ou","Ranking models primarily focus on modeling the relative order of predictions
while often neglecting the significance of the accuracy of their absolute
values. However, accurate absolute values are essential for certain downstream
tasks, necessitating the calibration of the original predictions. To address
this, existing calibration approaches typically employ predefined
transformation functions with order-preserving properties to adjust the
original predictions. Unfortunately, these functions often adhere to fixed
forms, such as piece-wise linear functions, which exhibit limited
expressiveness and flexibility, thereby constraining their effectiveness in
complex calibration scenarios. To mitigate this issue, we propose implementing
a calibrator using an Unconstrained Monotonic Neural Network (UMNN), which can
learn arbitrary monotonic functions with great modeling power. This approach
significantly relaxes the constraints on the calibrator, improving its
flexibility and expressiveness while avoiding excessively distorting the
original predictions by requiring monotonicity. Furthermore, to optimize this
highly flexible network for calibration, we introduce a novel additional loss
function termed Smooth Calibration Loss (SCLoss), which aims to fulfill a
necessary condition for achieving the ideal calibration state. Extensive
offline experiments confirm the effectiveness of our method in achieving
superior calibration performance. Moreover, deployment in Kuaishou's
large-scale online video ranking system demonstrates that the method's
calibration improvements translate into enhanced business metrics. The source

  Preference Optimization","Mingzhe Yu, Yunshan Ma, Lei Wu, Changshuo Wang, Xue Li, Lei Meng","Personalized outfit generation aims to construct a set of compatible and
personalized fashion items as an outfit. Recently, generative AI models have
received widespread attention, as they can generate fashion items for users to
complete an incomplete outfit or create a complete outfit. However, they have
limitations in terms of lacking diversity and relying on the supervised
learning paradigm. Recognizing this gap, we propose a novel framework
FashionDPO, which fine-tunes the fashion outfit generation model using direct
preference optimization. This framework aims to provide a general fine-tuning
approach to fashion generative models, refining a pre-trained fashion outfit
generation model using automatically generated feedback, without the need to
design a task-specific reward function. To make sure that the feedback is
comprehensive and objective, we design a multi-expert feedback generation
module which covers three evaluation perspectives, \ie quality, compatibility
and personalization. Experiments on two established datasets, \ie iFashion and
Polyvore-U, demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in enhancing the
model's ability to align with users' personalized preferences while adhering to
fashion compatibility principles. Our code and model checkpoints are available

2504.09935v1,Constrained Auto-Regressive Decoding Constrains Generative Retrieval,"Shiguang Wu, Zhaochun Ren, Xin Xin, Jiyuan Yang, Mengqi Zhang, Zhumin Chen, Maarten de Rijke, Pengjie Ren","Generative retrieval seeks to replace traditional search index data
structures with a single large-scale neural network, offering the potential for
improved efficiency and seamless integration with generative large language
models. As an end-to-end paradigm, generative retrieval adopts a learned
differentiable search index to conduct retrieval by directly generating
document identifiers through corpus-specific constrained decoding. The
generalization capabilities of generative retrieval on out-of-distribution
corpora have gathered significant attention.
  In this paper, we examine the inherent limitations of constrained
auto-regressive generation from two essential perspectives: constraints and
beam search. We begin with the Bayes-optimal setting where the generative
retrieval model exactly captures the underlying relevance distribution of all
possible documents. Then we apply the model to specific corpora by simply
adding corpus-specific constraints. Our main findings are two-fold: (i) For the
effect of constraints, we derive a lower bound of the error, in terms of the KL
divergence between the ground-truth and the model-predicted step-wise marginal
distributions. (ii) For the beam search algorithm used during generation, we
reveal that the usage of marginal distributions may not be an ideal approach.
This paper aims to improve our theoretical understanding of the generalization
capabilities of the auto-regressive decoding retrieval paradigm, laying a
foundation for its limitations and inspiring future advancements toward more
robust and generalizable generative retrieval.",cs.IR,2025-04-14T06:54:49+00:00,2025-04-14T06:54:49+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09935v1
